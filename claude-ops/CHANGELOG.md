# Changelog

## Unreleased

## [3.10.20] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed
- Unread status can no longer be used as an inbox-triage filter on WhatsApp,
  Slack, or Gmail. A message Sam opened and navigated away from without
  replying still owed a reply, so any scan step that relied on read/unread
  state to decide what needs him is wrong by design. `ops-inbox`, `ops-rules`,
  and the scan tooling now classify every open item by who spoke last, never
  by read state. A new `unread-filter-guard.py` hook hard-blocks the unread
  scan calls (`whatsapp_unread`, `mcp__slack__conversations_unreads`, and any
  `is:unread`/`unread_count`/`unread=1` filter passed to a terminal or code
  tool), wired into every box's pre-tool dispatcher. `tests/test-unread-filter-guard.sh`
  proves the block and allow shapes.

### Added
- `ops-release` now sweeps open pull requests before it cuts anything. Twice in
  one day a release went out while reviewed, good external PRs sat open, and
  both had to be merged by hand and the release re-cut. The new stage runs
  before the version bump, so the changelog and tag cover everything that
  landed. For every open PR against `main` — drafts and fork PRs included — it
  classifies the PR, approves workflow runs that GitHub is holding at
  `action_required`, dispatches one background review agent per PR (all of them
  together, so independent PRs are reviewed in parallel), and merges only what
  the agent blessed and the required checks report green. `skipped`, `neutral`
  and `cancelled` are not failures; `failure`, `timed_out`, `action_required`
  and `error` are. Anything the agent would not clearly bless, anything still
  red, still draft, or in conflict is reported and left open, and the release
  proceeds without it. The stage is on by default, `--no-sweep` skips it, and
  `--sweep-only` runs the sweep and stops. `--dry-run` never sweeps, since a
  sweep merges for real.

### Fixed
- A pull request from a fork looked permanently blocked. GitHub holds a fork's
  workflow runs at `action_required` until a maintainer approves them, so the
  required checks never started and `mergeable_state` stayed `blocked` forever.
  The sweep approves those held runs, which is what unblocked both stalled
  external contributions.


## [3.10.19] - 2026-09-16

### Added
- The plugin now notices its own staleness. `bin/ops-update-check` only ever ran
  from the daemon's daily cron and wrote a verdict to a state file that nothing
  read, so a box whose daemon was never installed could sit months behind
  without a word — one install surfaced this at 3.4.3 while 3.10.18 was
  published, 144 releases back. A new `PreToolUse` hook on `^Skill$`
  (`bin/ops-pretool-skill-update`) re-uses that same throttled check whenever an
  ops skill is invoked, so the first skill call of the day reports what the cron
  would have reported. `auto_update` in `preferences.json` picks the response:
  `off`, `notify` (default, just says so) or `auto`, which additionally runs
  `bin/ops-update` detached behind a lock and asks for a reload. `auto` is
  opt-in precisely because detection and application are otherwise kept apart;
  the running session keeps its old version until it reloads. The hook cannot
  block the skill it fired on — it exits 0 on every path, including a failing
  version check — and only fires for skills that belong to this plugin.
  Guard: `tests/test-skill-update-gate.sh` (10 cases).

### Fixed
- `ops-update` no longer deletes the tree it is running from. Step 5 pruned
  every cache version except the target, including the one the executing script
  lived in; bash reads a script incrementally, so that could truncate the update
  mid-run, and any session rooted in that version lost its hooks and scripts
  underneath it. The running version is now kept, with a note that the next run
  prunes it — by which time the live root has moved on. Guard: two cases in
  `tests/test-ops-update-downgrade-guard.sh`, mutation proven red.


## [3.10.18] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed
- The inbox scan no longer reports "email is handled" while people are still
  waiting. Its email half only asked Gmail for `in:inbox`, but that is a LABEL,
  not the state of the conversation: a filter, a category, a mute or one stray
  archive strips INBOX from a live thread. A Believe thread carrying finished
  video deliverables sat unanswered across three consecutive clean runs because
  Gmail had filed it away. `ops-inbox-scan` now runs a second email pass over
  archived, non-promotional, human mail within `--debt-days` (default 90) and
  reopens every thread whose newest message is inbound and never answered;
  those rows arrive in `email.needs_reply` tagged `forgotten: true` alongside a
  `forgotten_count` and an explaining note.
- An archive watermark can no longer bury a conversation. The sweep watermark
  that keeps deliberately-filed mail closed was stamping hundreds of threads in
  a single second, which silenced all twelve genuine two-way threads in one
  live run. Archiving is a filing decision, never evidence that a reply was
  sent, so a thread the owner has written into now survives its watermark and
  is closed only by the direction test. One-way pitches stay filed. Guard:
  `tests/test-ops-inbox-email-forgotten-debt.sh` (9 cases, two mutations
  proven red).
- `ops-dash` now converts every CALENDAR event into one display zone before
  printing it, instead of showing the raw clock half of each timestamp. Events
  from a calendar in a different zone previously rendered at that calendar's
  wall-clock time, so unrelated events could appear minutes apart and look like
  a conflict. The zone is resolved from `$OPS_TZ`, then `timezone` in
  `preferences.json`, then the system zone. All-day events are passed through
  unconverted so they cannot be dragged onto an adjacent day.
- `ops-update` can no longer downgrade the plugin by accident. On 2026-09-11
  the local marketplace clone sat at 3.10.13 with a dirty tree while v3.10.15
  was published; `claude plugin marketplace update` reported success without
  moving it, the stale-clone guard returned "not stale" because a git call
  failed inside it (fail-open), and the run pruned the installed 3.10.14 and
  3.10.15 caches, then printed "3.10.15 → 3.10.13 ✓ upgrade complete".
  Three guards now stand in the way: the clone check is fail-closed (an
  unverifiable clone aborts; new `--offline` turns that into a warning), the
  catalogue version is cross-checked against the newest remote `vX.Y.Z` tag,
  and a target that sorts below the installed version is refused — also with
  `--to` — unless the new `--allow-downgrade` flag is given. Step 5 never
  prunes a cache newer than the target without that flag and lists what it
  kept. Guard: `tests/test-ops-update-downgrade-guard.sh` (15 cases).


## [3.10.17] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed
- The `Agent` PreToolUse hook matcher is now anchored, so it only fires on the `Agent` tool instead of every tool whose name contains "Agent" (such as `ListAgents`).

### Changed
- `ops-speedup` now documents how heartbeat-triggered runs work: the saved prompt lives in the active Hermes database under the `heartbeat:<session_id>` state entry, and is executed in the current turn rather than through a non-existent CLI command.
- `ops-speedup` guidance on memory diagnostics is stricter: validate scan warnings with live samples before changing the machine, treat existing swap use as no proof of memory pressure, read `memory.high` at every cgroup ancestor rather than only the leaf, and verify a limit fix survives `daemon-reload` by checking all systemd drop-ins and the live cgroup value.

## [3.10.16] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed
- Outbound guard now ships the reservation-v2 guard, `ok` helper, and hook that the Node twin already expected, so approvals bind to a single exact draft instead of silently falling through.
- Post-update migration no longer records a temporary staging directory as the install path, which left later updates pointing at a directory that no longer exists.
- The config command stopped invoking a plugin subcommand that does not exist.
- Removed dead references in the `ops-daemon` and `ops-gtm` skills, and corrected stale pointers in the marketing and WhatsApp Business skill docs.

### Added
- `skill-doctor` script that checks skills for broken or dangling references.

## [3.10.15] - 2026-09-11

### Changed
WhatsApp health hook no longer advises a local bridge restart. Outbound-guard SessionStart sync cannot silently downgrade the Node twin.


## [3.10.14] - 2026-09-11

### Changed
- Fixed `ops-post-update-migrate` so a SessionStart hook from an older cached
  plugin version cannot rsync its stale tree over a newer `cache/ops/current`.

- Bounded the `ops-speedup` Docker reclaimable-space probe so an unavailable
  Docker daemon cannot hang diagnostics or the full test suite indefinitely.


## [3.10.13] - 2026-09-10

- Removed every hard-coded Claude model id and `model:` frontmatter pin; agents, skills and cron scripts now inherit the session default (env-overridable per script).

- Fixed `ops-release` to move the existing `Unreleased` body into the new version once, leaving a blank `Unreleased` heading for future changes.

- fix(security): a third party's identifiers can no longer reach this public
  repo. Every identity check was denylist-driven, and a denylist can only hold
  the operator's OWN terms — it structurally cannot hold a client's workspace
  UUIDs, their team key, or their issue ids, because nobody knows those in
  advance. Ten client Linear UUIDs, their team key in ~25 places plus a
  filename, and their real issue ids sat here while the scanner reported PASS.

  The rule is now inverted for identifier-shaped literals. `test-no-secrets.sh`
  fails every UUID and every `<KEY>-<number>` unless it is listed in the new
  `tests/known-public-constants.txt` with a stated reason, and fails an IANA
  timezone in code or config outright. The three checks need no configuration,
  sweep every tracked file including `tests/` (which `EXCLUDE_DIRS` drops, so
  the scanner's own directory was the one unscanned place), and cannot SKIP:
  a check that could not run counts as a failure. `.githooks/pre-commit` runs
  the same patterns over the staged diff so the blocked line is named.

  `tests/test-pii-gate-fires.sh` is the negative control — it plants the exact
  shapes that leaked and asserts each gate refuses them, plus a clean-tree
  control so a scanner that fails on everything cannot pass. It found four real
  defects on its first run: `grep -o` omits the filename when given a single
  file, which silently disabled every `:`-anchored filter; the issue-key regex
  stopped at six characters, so `<CLIENT>TEAM-<n>` was never seen; and both
  affected checks skipped instead of failing when the file list was empty.

  Also fixed: `PLUGIN_ROOT` now resolves with `pwd -P`. `git rev-parse
  --show-toplevel` returns a physical path, so under a symlinked checkout the
  comparison matched nothing and the sweep passed over an empty file list.

  Residual `Europe/Amsterdam` in two daemon cron notes and one script header —
  found by the new check, missed by a manual scrub — are now stated in UTC.

- fix(hooks): the pre-commit hook printed `BLOCKED` and committed anyway. It
  applied an amnesty to `$FAILED` *after* every check had run: if the only email
  hits were example domains it reset the flag to 0, clearing every other check
  that had already failed with it. The first commit of the gate above tripped
  three BLOCKED lines and landed regardless — loud and inert at once, which is
  worse than silent, because the output reads like enforcement.

  The example-domain filter now applies inside the email check, where it belongs,
  and the post-hoc reset is gone. The hook also honours the same path-exact
  exemption as the scanner, so the negative-control suites can hold the shapes
  they forbid without `--no-verify`.

  `tests/test-pre-commit-hook-blocks.sh` is the negative control for the hook
  itself: eight cases driven through a real `git commit`, asserting the exit
  status rather than the output, because the exit status is the only part of a
  hook that stops anything. Case 6 is this regression — a forbidden identifier
  in the same commit as a harmless `@example.com` address must still be refused.

- fix(hooks): UserPromptSubmit inbox autosync no longer interpolates `$INPUT`.
  Grok treats `$VAR` in a hook command as a required env var and skips the
  hook when it is unset. The script already reads the event JSON from stdin.
  Guard: `tests/test-hooks.sh` now flags `$INPUT` the same way as `$TOOL_INPUT`.

- fix(daemon): write `daemon-health.json` with builtin `printf` + `mv`, not
  `cat >file <<EOF`. Under launchd stdin is `/dev/null`, so bash's 16KiB
  heredoc pipe never drains and the first health write deadlocks — empty
  health file, no monitor loop. `check_self_upgrade` now picks the newest
  semver cache dir only, ignoring `current` and `ops-daemon-launcher.sh`.

- docs(whatsapp): dual-account MCP names are `whatsapp-nl` / `whatsapp-us` (or
  `whatsapp-<label>`). `whatsapp-cos` and a bare `whatsapp` client pointing at
  `/servers/whatsapp-cos/mcp` are not accounts — sending on them is a
  wrong-number send. Rule 8, ops-inbox, and `scripts/whatsapp/ENDPOINTS.md`
  now say so.

- fix(marketing): `ops-marketing-dash --project` no longer inherits the
  default brand's env / plugin-config / owner-level Amplitude, AppsFlyer,
  RevenueCat, Klaviyo, or Instagram credentials. A named project that is not
  `marketing.default_project` is isolated: missing project keys render as
  `null`, not another brand's numbers. Owner-brand fallback (no `--project`,
  or `--project` equal to the default) is unchanged. Guard:
  `tests/test-ops-marketing-dash-brand-isolation.sh`.

- fix(ops-inbox): always query every configured calendar, mailbox, and messaging
  channel before a schedule claim or NEEDS_REPLY draft. Google Calendar primary
  is not the show/tour SSOT — Notion show-schedule / calendar / appointments
  databases count when Notion is configured. A miss on one store is not absence.
  Rule 9, `ops-go`, and `tonight` carry the same gate. Owner-local calendar IDs
  live in `$PREFS_PATH` `.channels.notion.calendars`, never in this repo.

- fix(hooks): PreToolUse WhatsApp bridge health no longer interpolates `$TOOL_INPUT`.
  Grok treats `$VAR` in a hook command as a required env var and skips the hook
  when it is unset (`hook not executed: required env var(s) not set: ${TOOL_INPUT}`).
  Claude Code still sends the event JSON on stdin, so the script now reads stdin
  (argv kept for old callers). Do not put `$TOOL_INPUT` / `$TOOL_RESULT` /
  `$USER_PROMPT` in `hooks.json` command strings.

- fix(whatsapp): `ops-wa-accounts` resolves client-of-remote-bridge accounts from
  `$PREFS_PATH` `.channels.whatsapp` (written by `/ops:setup` step 3b) and
  `$OPS_DATA_DIR/registry.json` `.whatsapp`, with legacy
  `~/.config/whatsapp/agent-policy.json` as fallback. Policy `api` /
  `bridge_port` wins over a leftover local store. Inbox skills probe the
  resolved `api` (or `ssh` + `remote_store`); they never guess `:8080` and
  never `launchctl kickstart` a leftover local bridge. `ops-inbox-autosync`
  posts `/api/backfill` to each resolved `api`. Template:
  `scripts/registry.example.json`. Tests in `tests/test-ops-wa-accounts.sh`.

- fix(hermes): stop the native plugin registering duplicate `/ops-*` handlers.
  Hermes displays a plugin command handler's return value as the final reply,
  so those handlers echoed an instruction to load the skill and ended the turn
  before the agent ran anything. The cross-CLI installer already mirrors every
  claude-ops skill into Hermes' normal skills directory; those native skill
  slash commands now remain unshadowed and enter the agent loop as intended.

- fix(deploy-fix): `scripts/ops-deploy-monitor.sh` no longer calls `gh run watch`.
  That call blocks, polls every 2-5s with no tick cap, and is the exact pattern
  `hooks/gh-watch-guard.sh` denies for every other caller. The monitor is spawned
  by a PostToolUse hook on any `gh pr merge`, so one merge could arm an uncapped
  poller. It now polls `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{id}` on a 30s
  sleep floor, capped at 60 ticks and a 1800s wall-clock deadline. PR and run
  lookups moved from `gh pr view --json` / `gh run list --json` (GraphQL-backed)
  to `gh api repos/...` (REST). `gh api rate_limit` — which spends no quota —
  gates every polling phase and bails out with a log line below 200 remaining.
  The same banned patterns were removed from `skills/ops-deploy/SKILL.md`,
  `skills/ops-merge/SKILL.md` and `skills/ops-merge/references/cli.md`, which
  had been telling agents to run them. `tests/mocks/gh` now serves the REST
  endpoints and exits 90 if anything invokes `gh run watch`; test case 12 in
  `tests/test-deploy-fix-hooks.sh` guards the script against regression.

- Slim `ops-inbox` SKILL.md (~6k → ~2k words): runtime, Workflow JS, and Agent Teams moved to `references/`. Rewrite remaining skill descriptions with real NL triggers (Claude / Grok / Hermes share the same `skills/` tree).
- Sync harness ports: `hermes-plugin/plugin.yaml` version matches `plugin.json`; installer default ref tracks the latest tag; `ops-release` bumps both. Grok still loads the Claude plugin (no `.grok-plugin`). Docs: `.mcp.json` is empty on purpose.

- feat(cliproxy-heal): unattended hub healer puts seats back in rotation as soon as any leftover or reset quota is observed (no hysteresis). A seat sits out only on certain "quota exhausted" plus a parseable reschedule stamp, then re-enters at that stamp. An AI advisor runs on every seat and cannot override those rules. `applied=reauth` only after `CLIPROXY_REAUTH_CMD` (`cliproxy-reauth-one.sh` → hub `bu_reauth_lib.py` / `xai_device_reauth.py`); otherwise the seat is recorded blocked. Hub systemd timer `cliproxy-heal.timer`; Mac stays client-only. `runHealTick` denies healing unless both gates are satisfied: the `CLIPROXY_HUB_HEAL=1` env var, and the presence of the `/opt/crsproxy/.heal-account-optin` marker file that only `install-heal.sh` writes (not the systemd unit's `Environment=` lines), so editing the unit alone cannot satisfy both. Tests in `scripts/account-rotation/__tests__/cliproxy-heal-policy.test.mjs`.
- fix(ops-mac): the application firewall is opt-in. `/ops:mac fix` no longer offers to enable it and no longer lists it as a recommendation; the audit reports its state and stops. Turning the firewall on breaks local listeners (dev servers, MCP proxies, VNC, tunnels) and the user rarely connects the breakage to a `fix` run they asked for other reasons. `socketfilterfw` now runs only when the user asks for the firewall by name in that turn.
- **Removed the CRS relay backend.** claude-relay-service handed every session a
  static `cr_` bearer token pinned into `settings.json`, and the plugin had to keep
  base URL and token in lockstep across respawns, settings overlays and daemons.
  CLIProxyAPI is now the only supported path for multi-account rotation and OAuth
  seat management: it holds one OAuth seat file per account, and `rotate.mjs`
  already writes those files during a rotation.
  Deleted: the `crs-*` daemons in `scripts/account-rotation/`, the three
  `install-crs-*.sh` installers, the five `crs-*` systemd units, the
  `com.claude-ops.crs-*` plists, and `docs/runbooks/crs-full-tuning-plan.md`.
  Kept: `scripts/crsproxy-reauth/`. An earlier draft of this entry listed it as
  deleted, but it survived the CRS removal and still carries the Browser Use
  OAuth reauthentication helpers, which are cliproxy-facing rather than CRS-only.
  It is covered by `tests/test-crsproxy-reauth.sh`.
  Renamed, same behaviour: `crs-pool-config.mjs` → `rotation-config.mjs`,
  `crs-refresh-lock.mjs` → `refresh-lock.mjs`, `crs-reconciler-state.mjs` →
  `reconciler-state.mjs`.
  Migration on an existing machine: route mode `crs-oauth` is read as `oauth`, a
  `crs` config block is read as the `rotation` block, `CRS_REFRESH_*` env names
  still work, and reconciler state files fall back to their old names. Background
  respawn strips a leftover relay base URL, `cr_` token and `--settings` overlay
  rather than re-applying them. `claude-stack doctor` reports a leftover pair as
  `legacy_relay_env`; `claude-stack route --mode oauth` clears it.
  `ops-accounts crs` and `crs-tick` now print where rotation lives and exit 2.
- fix(whatsapp): `apply-patches.py` Fix Q no longer appends a duplicate `/api/app_state_status` route. The sentinel gated on the comment text, which Fix Y later rewrote to `Fix Q/Y`, so on any tree that had taken Fix Y the check missed and a second `http.HandleFunc` for the same path was added. Go panics at startup on a duplicate pattern, so the bridge died on the next `go build`. The sentinel is now the handler registration itself, which is stable across variants.
- docs(whatsapp): stop assuming the MCP server is named `whatsapp`. Multi-account installs run one bridge and one server per account (`whatsapp-<label>`) and have no plain `mcp__whatsapp__*`, so every hardcoded reference failed with an unknown tool. Adds CLAUDE.md Rule 8 (resolve the name at runtime, pick the account deliberately, never send from the wrong number, Rule 6 applies to every variant) and points ops-inbox, ops-comms, comms-scanner, and `scripts/whatsapp/ENDPOINTS.md` at it. Also warns that `allowed-tools` entries are exact strings and that host send-gate hook matchers pinned to the literal `mcp__whatsapp__send_message` silently stop firing when an account is renamed or added.
- Security: replace direct/unattended Claude browser reauthentication with short-lived HMAC-approved, single-use staged enrollment and atomic rollback activation; legacy reauth wrappers now fail closed.
- ops-accounts-gateway skeleton (:3005 health/auth/grok hop; CLI gateway subcommand)
- feat(crs-priority-daemon): dual-mode `backend=crs|local` file seat-state without CRS Docker

- ops-accounts: dual-write + OPS_ACCOUNTS_BACKEND auto/crs/local; grok-cli-auth-proxy; local no-op reconcilers; gateway design doc

### Changed

- **ops-accounts multi-provider plan:** every provider (Claude, Grok, OpenAI/Codex, Factory, Cursor) gets Anthropic-shaped OAuth, reauth, util, switch/LB under `/ops:accounts`.
- **CLIProxyAPI gateway path:** absorb gateway + Claude seat policy + Grok OAuth proxy into ops-accounts so default installs use CLIProxyAPI-compatible relay behavior without requiring the deprecated relay stack; external legacy CRS stays advanced-only. See `docs/ops/OPS-ACCOUNTS-VISION.md`.
- **ops-accounts seat policy (local):** `seat-policy-tick.mjs` applies conservative 5h/7d schedulable thresholds to local seat-state without a relay; `ops-accounts seats tick`.
- **ops-accounts local seat-state:** `seat-state.mjs` file-backed multi-provider seat store (schedulable/util) for local policy backend; `ops-accounts seats` command.
- **ops-accounts skill merge:** `/ops:accounts` is canonical multi-provider entry; `/ops:rotate` and `/ops:rotate-setup` are aliases. Expanded `bin/ops-accounts` (status/util/switch/refresh/reauth/setup/crs). Added `grok-reauth-egress.sh` residential cascade (EFG SOCKS → Bright Data tiers) for Grok device OAuth.

- **Required companion co-install:** companions essential to ops commands are no longer optional setup prompts. `plugin-dependencies.json` marks `desktop-act`, `gsd`, `gstack` (skills clone), `superpowers`, and `feature-dev` as `required: true` with `updateWithOps: always` and `essentialFor` command lists. `scripts/install-companions.sh` always installs missing required companions (even under `--update-only`), and `--status` exits 1 when any required companion is missing. `/ops:setup` Step 2b runs the SSOT script without Skip for required deps. `/ops:update` step 9 co-installs the full required set (still skippable only via `--no-companions` / `OPS_SKIP_COMPANIONS=1`). Adds `scripts/install-gstack-companion.sh` (env-templated `GSTACK_REPO`/`GSTACK_DIR`/`GSTACK_BRANCH`).


### Added

- **ops-update companions:** step 9 runs `scripts/install-companions.sh` from `plugin-dependencies.json` — co-install/update all **required** companions (`desktop-act`, `gsd`, `gstack` skills-clone, `superpowers`, `feature-dev`). Flag: `--no-companions`.
- **ops-accounts phase 0 surface:** `skills/ops-accounts` + `bin/ops-accounts` router (status/switch/refresh/reauth) over Claude rotate-magic, grok-rotate/oauth-reauth, and codex-rotate when present.

- **Standalone captcha cascade (no CRS required):** port portable captcha stack into `scripts/account-rotation/` — `captcha-helper.mjs`, `visual-captcha-solver.mjs`, `bright-data-cascade.mjs`, orchestration `captcha-cascade.mjs`, thin `rotate-magic.mjs` entry. Plugin `rotate.mjs` soft-loads the cascade after magic-link verify. Contract: `CAPTCHA-CASCADE.md`. Gap report: `docs/ops/HOST-VS-PLUGIN-ROTATE-GAP.md`.
- **CRS optional UX:** `/ops:rotate-setup` Step 4.4 detects CRS (PATH / health / `crs.enabled`) and asks install vs standalone rotate-magic (recommended for single/few accounts) vs skip. `/ops:rotate` documents standalone `reauth` and never treats missing CRS as failure. `--standalone` flag on setup.
- **ops-accounts vision (phase 0):** multi-provider `/ops:accounts` is the north star (Claude/Codex/Grok adapters, refresh+reauth dispatcher). Claude captcha port + CRS-optional are enablers under that contract, not a late rename. `docs/ops/OPS-ACCOUNTS-VISION.md` — future rename ops-rotate → multi-provider ops-accounts; cherry-pick balancer ideas; no fork in this release.

- **desktop-act marketplace companion:** `desktop-act` is published in `ops-marketplace` next to `ops` (source `./desktop-act`). Declared as a co-install dependency in `plugin.json` + `plugin-dependencies.json`. `scripts/install-desktop-act-companion.sh` installs via `claude plugin install desktop-act@ops-marketplace` (idempotent). `/ops:setup` and `/ops:update` co-install by default (`desktop_act_co_install`). Launcher resolves `ops-marketplace/desktop-act` before cache clone; default bootstrap repo is Lifecycle-Innovations-Limited/desktop-act.
- **magic-link-autoloop reauth env (portable):** unattended re-auth child now inherits an env-templated headed seat + captcha cascade contract (`reauth-env.mjs`, `CAPTCHA-CASCADE.md`). Defaults: headed display from `CLAUDE_DESKTOP_DISPLAY` / `DESKTOP_ACT_DISPLAY`, visual + desktop-act + VNC layers on when present, 20m rotate timeout, no steal-lock, sticky `SKIP_TOKEN_SOLVERS=1` cleared. Dispatch mode `setup` (default) or `magic-link` via `$CRS_MAGIC_LINK_DISPATCH` / `crs.magicLinkDispatch`. Shell wrapper resolves plugin via `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` (no host hardcodes). Launchd template + `config.example.json` document the knobs.
- **installer (`claude-ops-installer`, v0.1.0):** cross-CLI `npx claude-ops-installer install` — auto-detects Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenClaw, Hermes, and OpenCode, mirrors upstream skills + binstubs into each agent's expected layout, ships with a central `~/.config/claude-ops-installer/config.yaml`, and supports `install` / `update` / `verify` / `doctor` / `uninstall` / `agents` subcommands. One source of truth (the upstream marketplace repo at the pinned ref); per-agent manifest at `~/.cache/claude-ops-installer/manifest.json` enables surgical uninstall. Public-repo clean: no PII, no hardcoded paths, no embedded credentials.

- **ops-desk (new skill):** `/ops:ops-desk` desk sweep — fans out read-only context agents (batched, Workflow tool) over the owner's open decisions/drafts/payments/sign-offs and returns a ranked, ready-to-approve action queue worked down under the per-draft outbound gate. Complements `/ops:ops-inbox`.
- **ops-ecom:** `channels` | `agentic` | `shop` verbs — sales channel inventory, agentic storefront health, Shop Campaigns readiness (read-only; Rule 5 / stage-only spend).
- **ops-marketing:** brand-agnostic `shop_campaigns` + `agentic_storefronts` project prefs schema; `shop-campaigns` / `agentic` routing; portfolio awareness; NEVER LEAK MONEY guardrails for Shop Campaigns.


## [3.10.12] - 2026-09-09

### Changed
- fix(orchestrate,next): read the synced registry schema, not the example one (#952)


## [3.10.11] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- fix(ops-release): a `--notes` body that already opens its own
  `### Added|Changed|Fixed|Removed` section no longer gets an empty
  `### Changed` prepended. The GitHub release workflow awk-parses the CHANGELOG
  section verbatim, so v3.10.10's published notes opened with a heading that had
  nothing under it and had to be patched by hand.
  `tests/test-ops-release-changelog-heading.sh` lifts the block straight out of
  `bin/ops-release`, so the test cannot drift from the shipped code; it is red
  against v3.10.10 and green here.

### Changed

- docs(ops-rules): precedence tiers plus rules 11-17.

### Testing

- test(hooks): `tests/test-hooks.sh` fails any hook that is neither
  `async: true` nor bounded by a `timeout`. v3.10.8 put a bound on the Stop hook
  `ops-post-session-cleanup`, but nothing stopped the next hook from landing
  without one — in `hooks.json` a hook that blocks looks exactly like a hook that
  does not, and an unbounded blocking hook holds the event open until its command
  returns. Async hooks are exempt on purpose: they never hold the event, so a
  timeout there would invent a problem. Proved in both directions against the
  pre-fix `hooks.json` (1 failed) and the current tree (25 passed).

## [3.10.10] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- **The MCP watchdog no longer tells you to re-authenticate servers that work fine.** It probed every HTTP MCP with an `initialize` POST and read a 401 as "no refresh token, the owner must re-consent". A 401 only means that when the probe actually *presented* a credential; with nothing to send it says only that the prober knocked with empty hands. Claude Code holds OAuth tokens for natively-authenticated HTTP MCPs in memory — not in `~/.mcp-auth`, not in the keychain's `mcpOAuth` entries, not in the config's static headers — so those servers answer every session normally and probe 401 forever. Measured here: `claude-design` and `openrouter` both sat at `needs_bootstrap` while `list_projects` returned 13 projects and `ping` returned `pong`. The cost was not just a wrong line in a report — every tick dispatched the headless fix agent (10 runs logged) and attempted a Playwright OAuth flow that cannot succeed, because the consent page renders no button for an unauthenticated profile. The blind case is now its own state, `no_probe_credential`, and it is excluded from fix-agent dispatch, auto-reauth, the degradation diff and WhatsApp notify, the `ops-doctor` degraded>1h warning, and `/ops:mcp` advice. A `healthy` → `no_probe_credential` transition is still logged, so a token that really did disappear leaves a trace instead of vanishing into a state the watchdog ignores. Guard: `tests/test-mcp-watchdog-probe-credential.sh` covers all four 401 paths plus the consumer guards — 11 passed against this change, 7 of them failing against the previous version.

## [3.10.9] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- **Background daemon no longer restart-loops.** The SessionStart `ensure-current` hook and the plist-guard LaunchAgent were both rewriting the daemon's launchd plist with different paths, boot-cycling the job every ~10 seconds so it never completed a monitor pass — services sat at "scheduled" forever while the health file kept looking fresh. An intentional executable daemon wrapper under the plugin data dir is now respected instead of being overwritten as drift; genuinely stale, non-executable, or dangling paths are still repaired.
- **`/ops:fires` no longer reports Sentry as unavailable on every run.** The `allowed-tools` frontmatter named `mcp__sentry__*` while the plugin registers `mcp__plugin_sentry_sentry__*`, so the tool never existed under the name the skill asked for. Sentry is now pre-gathered over REST by `bin/ops-sentry`, the same way infra, CI and external health already are, and a non-null `error` from that probe reads as a gap in coverage rather than as "production is clean". Found the hard way: a fires run showed zero Sentry issues while a Bedrock `ServiceUnavailableException` had been hitting four users for thirteen hours.
- **`ops-projects` no longer renders `None`.** `.get(key, default)` returns an explicit JSON `null` instead of the default; the fields now fall back with `or`.
- **GA4 and Search Console data no longer read as "no data".** `file:`-prefixed credential references were never resolved, so the provisioned service-account key was skipped and every call silently fell back to expiring user credentials. The prefix is now handled, and the marketing dashboard reads the per-project key the provisioner actually writes rather than a legacy owner-level field.
- **Search Console calls no longer fail with a scopes error.** The service-account token is minted with `webmasters.readonly` alongside `analytics.readonly`, since both APIs share it. Previously every SEO figure degraded to an empty result instead of surfacing the 403.
- **Marketing health checks report the truth.** The `ga4_sa_key` and `gsc_auth` probes now use the same credential as the data path, so they stop flagging every project as broken while pulls are working — a false alarm that masked real per-project failures.

## [3.10.8] - 2026-09-08

### Changed
Begrens de Stop-hook ops-post-session-cleanup met timeout 5. Van de veertien hooks die de plugin registreert was dit de enige die blokkeerde zonder grens, waardoor een hangende cleanup het einde van elke sessie kon ophouden. Gemeten duur 146ms.


## [3.10.7] - 2026-09-06

### Changed
Inbox sweep now treats an archived chat as dealt with. The recency floor was overriding the archive flag for anything touched in the last 7 days, so a swept account still reported handled threads as unanswered and inbox zero could not be reached. The corruption net now arms only on stores that still have open chats.


## [3.10.6] - 2026-09-06

### Changed
### Fixed — inbox zero was unreachable by construction

Three defects in the inbox toolchain, all found in one live run, all failing the
same way: a value was read from configuration, or from one store, when the truth
lived somewhere else.

- **A completed inbox-zero run was diagnosed as flag corruption.** With every
  chat archived, `ops-inbox-scan` fell back to `handled=0` as its working set.
  Nothing in the toolchain ever writes `handled`, so that predicate matched 1803
  of 1806 archived chats and the entire history came back as unanswered asks —
  171 false NEEDS_REPLY across two accounts, moments after the inbox was
  genuinely empty. The better a sweep did its job, the louder the next scan
  disagreed. The corruption fallback now fires only when `handled` is
  demonstrably in use; genuine corruption still recovers the live thread, and
  the scan states which verdict it reached and why.
- **A reply sent from one WhatsApp number did not count on the other.** One
  person exists in both stores under different jids, and an outgoing message
  lands only in the store it was sent from — so the second account still saw an
  unanswered thread and offered a duplicate reply. The scan now reads every
  other account's store as read-only evidence and demotes those threads with a
  stated `reconciled` reason. Auto-discovered; `--peer-store` names one
  explicitly, `--no-peer-stores` disables it. This matters more now that
  `--all-accounts` scans both numbers in a single pass.
- **The bridge port came from a launcher script that need not exist.**
  `ops-wa-accounts` scanned `run-bridge.sh` for `WA_PORT` and fell back to 8080,
  so two bridges started any other way both reported 8080 while actually
  listening on 8082 and 8083 — pointing every read, archive and reply at one
  number. The port is now read from the live listening socket via `/proc`, the
  same way the phone number is read from the store, and every account reports
  `port_source` so a caller can tell a live value from a guess.

Also: `ops-inbox-archive-set --dry-run` no longer reports zero planned archives
on a multi-account box. It refused to count anything when the bridge port was
unresolved, including under a dry run that contacts no bridge at all, so the
preview silently disagreed with the real run. The refusal now applies only to a
live `--apply`, where a wrong port is unrecoverable.


## [3.10.5] - 2026-09-05

### Changed
Verify the Hermes native plugin link, not just the skills mirror. A stale real-directory copy of hermes-plugin at ~/.hermes/plugins/ops now fails verify/doctor instead of silently reporting clean.


## [3.10.4] - 2026-08-29

### Changed
Fix Linux/WSL startup probe counting the systemctl legend line as a failed unit, which applied a permanent -5 health penalty and a false failed-startup-units factor on healthy boxes.


## [3.10.3] - 2026-08-29

### Changed
- fix(ops): memory extractor, proxy auth, and unread-bridge follow-ups (#908)


## [3.10.2] - 2026-08-28

### Changed
Grok skipped the inbox autosync hook because $INPUT in hooks.json is treated as a required env var.


## [3.10.1] - 2026-08-28

### Changed
Fixed multi-source inbox checks, full-resolution social ads and Google Ads v24, WhatsApp account naming, and a broker socket readiness race.


## [3.10.0] - 2026-08-28

### Changed
- feat(skills): relations + vip skills, all config in plugin.json (#902)


## [3.9.9] - 2026-08-28

### Changed
ops-marketing-dash --project no longer inherits the default brand's Amplitude, AppsFlyer, RevenueCat, Klaviyo, or Instagram credentials.


## [3.9.8] - 2026-08-28

### Changed
PreToolUse WhatsApp bridge health reads the event from stdin. Do not interpolate $TOOL_INPUT in hook command strings (Grok skips the hook when that env var is unset).


## [3.9.7] - 2026-08-28

### Changed
WhatsApp client bridges resolve from plugin-written $PREFS_PATH / registry; no guessed :8080.


## [3.9.6] - 2026-08-27

### Changed
fix(hermes): the native Hermes plugin no longer registers duplicate /ops-* slash command handlers. Hermes shows a plugin command handler's return value as the final reply, so those handlers echoed a skill-loading instruction and ended the turn before the agent ran anything. Slash commands now come solely from the installer-mirrored Hermes skills and enter the agent loop as intended; the plugin keeps namespaced skill_view("ops:*") registration.


## [3.9.5] - 2026-08-26

### Changed
### Fixed
- Stop an untrusted request path from re-pointing the auto-router (#885).
- Replace `gh run watch` in deploy-fix with bounded REST polling (#886).
- Stop the MCP repair agent mutating cloud infrastructure (#887).


## [3.9.4] - 2026-08-24

### Changed
- fix(flow): pass the project path to flow-state, or PROJECT-MODE never triggers (#883)


## [3.9.3] - 2026-08-24

### Changed
- fix(paths): stop resolving four helpers through ~/Projects, which exists on no install (#881)


## [3.9.2] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed
- `/flow` now resolves its lifecycle reference on macOS (renamed the skill's internal map file to avoid a case-insensitive filename collision).


## [3.9.1] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed
- `FLOW` now routes the full installed toolchain instead of only part of it, so commands are dispatched to the right tool.
- Corrected an unquoted heredoc in the registry sync script that could expand shell variables in its output.


## [3.9.0] - 2026-08-23

### Changed
### Added
- **ops-ar taste profile injection.** When `ar.profile` exists in preferences, the whole object is injected into every ar-producer spawn so verdicts are calibrated to the owner's own catalog, tempo range and songwriting taste, and REFERENCE & POSITIONING names the closest catalog comparison instead of a generic genre act. Absent profile falls back to the generic default and says so in the card header.
- **ops-ar imprint gate.** Imprints defined under `ar.imprints` get an IMPRINT section on the A&R card, scored against that imprint's own ten-point test, plus one routing line. An imprint is a strict subset of the label, so a failed gate routes the release and never downgrades the main verdict.
- **ops-inbox step 0.** Reading a thread's own sent messages is now a blocking pre-check on every connected account before anything is classed NEEDS_REPLY. A scan result is a snapshot rather than current state, and a subagent's NEEDS_REPLY is a claim about the moment it looked.

### Changed
- Imprints are data, not code. The imprint gate reads every imprint's name, lane, sound description and test from preferences rather than assuming one hardcoded imprint, so any number of imprints work.
- Corrected the CRS-removal entry, which listed `scripts/crsproxy-reauth/` as deleted. It was kept, holds the Browser Use OAuth reauthentication helpers, and is covered by `tests/test-crsproxy-reauth.sh`.

### Removed
- Dead gitleaks allowlist entry for the RFC 6238 TOTP vector. The constant is now assembled from fragments, so the full string appears nowhere in the tree and the exclusion had nothing left to excuse.

### Migration
- `ar.future_tropical` in `preferences.json` moves to `ar.imprints.<key>` with a `display_name` added. Nothing reads the old key, so an unmigrated profile simply skips the IMPRINT section.


## [3.8.1] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed
- The release command now aborts instead of proceeding when it cannot read the currently published version, so a release can no longer be cut from an unknown baseline.

### Changed
- Version bumps are derived from the published version rather than local state, keeping release numbering consistent.
- Added test coverage for profile-first reauth and for version-bump behaviour during releases.


## [3.8.0] - 2026-08-22

### Changed
- Specialist discovery no longer loads every skill's context up front. The `ops` skill now resolves capabilities from a generated reference index and pulls specialist detail only when a command needs it, cutting startup token cost across all `ops-*` skills.

### Fixed
- Secret scanning no longer fails CI on the published RFC 6238 TOTP test vector, which is a spec example rather than a real credential.


## [3.7.0] - 2026-08-22

### Changed
### Added
- Added Browser Use OAuth reauthentication 2FA support with 1Password Connect TOTP and human checkpoint modes.
- Added policy-driven two_factor examples for reauth account configuration.

### Changed
- Migrated current-facing ops wording from deprecated CRS terminology to cliproxy / CLIProxyAPI while preserving runtime compatibility aliases.
- Updated account-rotation and ops-account surfaces for the CLIProxyAPI-first flow.

### Fixed
- Fixed shell syntax validation for the rm -rf safety hook.
- Removed operator identity literals from Hermes Linear helpers so public secret and PII scans pass.


## [3.6.2] - 2026-08-22

### Changed
- README, INDEX, and harness-ports docs for Claude / Grok / Hermes.


## [3.6.1] - 2026-08-22

### Changed
- Slim ops-inbox SKILL.md (~6k → ~2k) and rewrite remaining skill descriptions with real NL triggers.
- Keep Hermes plugin.yaml and the installer pin in lockstep with plugin.json so Claude, Grok, and Hermes ship the same version.
- Document that plugin .mcp.json is empty on purpose (MCP starts on demand).


## [3.6.0] - 2026-08-22

### Changed
Skills match plugin-dev practice: ops-rules skill (root CLAUDE.md is a pointer), third-person frontmatter and shared preamble on every skill, oversized SKILL.md files split into references/, SessionStart pointer, plugin validate coverage.


## [3.5.0] - 2026-08-22

### Changed
Native Hermes plugin: slash commands, skill_view("ops:*"), Rule 10 harness fallbacks, installer ~/.hermes/plugins/ops.


## [3.4.4] - 2026-08-18

### Changed
Fix boss agent-dash resolution and macOS pressure evidence check


## [3.4.3] - 2026-08-18

### Changed
### Fixed
- WhatsApp bridge LaunchAgent now runs the supervised `run-bridge.sh` wrapper instead of the bare binary, so a logged-out bridge can no longer request pairing codes unattended (the behaviour that gets an account banned). KeepAlive gains `Crashed`, and ThrottleInterval goes 60 -> 300.
- The bridge LaunchAgent template now sets `GODEBUG=netdns=go`, which the bridge requires on macOS. With the cgo resolver the whatsmeow websocket dies with "failed to read frame header: EOF" and pairing fails as a misleading "Couldn't link device" on the phone.
- `ops-post-update-migrate` refuses to install the bridge LaunchAgent when `run-bridge.sh` is missing, and defers its per-version sentinel so the skip is retried next session instead of becoming permanent.


## [3.4.2] - 2026-08-16

### Changed
### Fixed
- ops-speedup scored a perfect 100/100 from empty probes on macOS. It published probe results with `declare -g`, which bash 3.2 does not have, and an existing stderr redirect swallowed the error, so every probe variable stayed unset. The assignments are portable now, and the tests run the JSON contract under `/bin/bash` as well. (#827)
- The `rm -rf` guard blocked nothing on stock macOS. (#826)
- ops-release: a failed CI query no longer strands the release PR. (#820)

### Changed
- ops-inbox: stage drafts as cards, and never end a run with a question. (#821)


## [3.4.1] - 2026-08-16

### Changed
- ops-release: a failed tag push no longer aborts the run. The release PR has already merged by then, so a dead git transport left main released but untagged. It now resolves main's commit over the REST API when `git fetch` fails, creates the tag object and ref over the API when `git push` fails, and names the ref to create if both fail. API calls retry pinned to the other IP family. (#817)
- ops-sync-docs / ops-release: the badge regex required a `-` straight after the digits, so a count carrying a URL-encoded `+` (`skills-33%2B-success`) never matched and stayed frozen at 33 while the tree grew to 63. It now matches the suffix and drops it — the count is exact, not a floor. (#817)


## [3.4.0] - 2026-08-16

### Changed
- ops-mac: the application firewall is opt-in. `/ops:mac fix` no longer offers or recommends enabling it; the audit reports its state and stops. Turning it on breaks local listeners — dev servers, MCP proxies, VNC, tunnels — and the breakage surfaces long after the run. `socketfilterfw` runs only when the firewall is asked for by name. (#814)
- ops-inbox no longer hardcodes `127.0.0.1:8080`. On a box running one whatsmeow bridge per phone number the lowest port answers first, which bound the skill to whichever number owned 8080 and sent replies from the wrong account. New `bin/ops-wa-accounts` discovers every bridge and reads the number actually paired in each store. (#815)
- ops-inbox / ops-comms: port the Hermes ops lessons — triage is not the deliverable, dedupe merged WhatsApp threads by message ID, transcribe outbound voice notes, and an output quality gate to prove before reporting a pass complete. (#813)


## [3.3.1] - 2026-08-15

### Changed

- The outbound guard now refuses to send from a Gmail send-as alias whose SMTP relay is broken. Such a send fails silently: Gmail stamps the message SENT and drops the delivery failure into Trash, so the sender believes it arrived and the recipient never gets it. The check runs ahead of every path that would otherwise allow the send, including a held approval and the approved-recipient bypass, because a broken relay bounces the mail whoever it was addressed to.
- When a service account can impersonate the alias, the block message names the command that works. Sending as the mailbox over the API skips the send-as relay entirely and needs no app password, so a "broken" alias is often already reachable.
- New `refresh_broken_aliases.py` builds the alias list from Gmail's own bounce threads, reading the failed alias off the SENT message's `From` header rather than matching addresses in the bounce body. `--clear <address>` drops an alias after a repair, and an absent or empty list blocks nothing.
- New `gog-sa-token` mints a narrow-scope impersonated token. `gog` requests its whole scope bundle in one call, so a Workspace that delegated only `gmail.send` and `gmail.readonly` refuses the entire request, and a mailbox that can in fact send looks unreachable.
- New `tests/outbound-guard/test-broken-alias.py` covers the alias path against a throwaway `HOME`, and clears the shared approval store afterwards so the other guard suites stay order-independent.


## [3.3.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- Shared outbound guard that gates every outbound send through one code path, with matching hook entry points for Python and Node callers.
- Test suite for the guard covering the hook matrix, false positives, and shared-guard behaviour.
- Approval helper for granting a send, plus a README documenting how the gate works and how to wire it up.

### Changed
- `ops-comms` and `ops-inbox` now route sends through the shared guard instead of their own checks.


## [3.2.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- `ops-inbox-archive-set`: turns a scan into explicit ARCHIVE and KEEP lists instead of leaving the call to eye judgement. Report-only by default, archives nothing without `--apply`, never sends. Mail carrying a todo/action label can't be swept, and anything ambiguous resolves to KEEP.
- Test suite for the archive split, label guardrail, report-only default, dry-run apply and stale window, run entirely against a fixture so tests can't touch a real inbox.
- Per-channel archive documentation: email archiving needs thread ids, multi-account WhatsApp installs must resolve the real per-account server name first, and iMessage, Slack and Telegram have no archive at all.

### Changed
- The scan working set per channel is now "not archived" rather than unread or a recent slice. Email scans all of `in:inbox` up to 400 results; Slack stays unread-and-unreplied because it has no archive.
- `--days` now only sizes the WhatsApp send-log lookback. Use `--email-query` / `--email-max` to narrow the mail set on purpose.
- Reply and archive are a single step: send, verify the reply landed on the channel, then archive. An unverified send leaves the thread open.
- Archive and mark-read no longer sit behind the outbound approval gate. They change local state only and undo cleanly; real external sends stay gated.
- FYI is a review list, not sweep material. It gets read and summarized, anything money, contract, legal, security or deadline related is promoted out of it, and mass-archiving is only offered after that.

### Fixed
- The email scan searched a 7-day, 30-result window, so anything older or further down silently stopped being reported as needing a reply.
- Removed exponential backtracking in the courtesy-reply matcher (CodeQL high severity). Message bodies come straight off WhatsApp, so a crafted message could hang an entire scan.
- Undescribed media such as a bare `[image]` was read as an empty message and archived as a closing courtesy. Unenriched media now always keeps the thread.
- A positional `scan` argument overwrote `--scan`, making the tool ignore the scan file it was given and re-scan live.


## [3.1.5] - 2026-08-15

### Changed
Added: bin/ops-fleet-pool-snapshot fetches a sanitized read-only CLIProxyAPI pool snapshot from a remote helper over ssh, and ops-fleet is reworked into a read-only session plus gateway dashboard that uses it. The helper restricts the remote path to a plain safe-character path, rejects a destination or user beginning with a dash so ssh cannot read it as an option, confines the timeout to digits, and validates the remote output as JSON before emitting it. Fixed: ops-inbox now rechecks the live thread tail immediately before every send. Approval is not a license to fire a stale draft, so between the approval and the send call it re-reads the real channel for new inbound arriving after the draft was staged and for replies already sent from another session, the phone, or a different client, and rebuilds or drops the draft instead of double-replying. A scan from earlier in the same run does not count as current state.


## [3.1.4] - 2026-08-15

### Changed
Fixed: apply-patches.py Fix Q no longer appends a duplicate /api/app_state_status route. The idempotency sentinel matched the comment above the handler, which Fix Y later rewrote, so on any Fix-Y tree the check missed and a second http.HandleFunc for the same path was appended. Go panics at startup on a duplicate pattern, so the bridge died on the next go build. The sentinel is now the handler registration itself. Fixed: the plugin no longer assumes the WhatsApp MCP server is named whatsapp. Multi-account installs run one bridge and one server per account (whatsapp-<label>) and have no plain mcp__whatsapp__*, so every hardcoded reference failed with an unknown tool. Adds CLAUDE.md Rule 8 (resolve the name at runtime, pick the account deliberately, never reply from the wrong number, Rule 6 applies to every variant) and points ops-inbox, ops-comms, comms-scanner and scripts/whatsapp/ENDPOINTS.md at it. Also warns that allowed-tools entries are exact strings and that host send-gate hook matchers pinned to the literal mcp__whatsapp__send_message stop firing silently when an account is renamed or added.


## [3.1.3] - 2026-08-15

### Changed
ops-merge no longer scans or merges repos the owner cannot push to. The registry lists every locally cloned project, including upstreams we only read, so the queue filled with unrelated contributors' PRs in repos we do not own. Push access is now checked fail-closed immediately before every create, merge and push, --repo is no longer exempt, the scanner accepts both --repo <slug> and a bare slug, and OPS_MERGE_INCLUDE_EXTERNAL takes a single slug instead of acting as a global bypass.


## [3.1.2] - 2026-08-10

### Changed
Runtime-first ops-speedup: CPU/RAM/GPU/PID/DNS/TCP health scoring, safer demotion defaults, and CI harness fixes.


## [3.1.1] - 2026-08-03

### Changed
- Update the Telegram server's transitive Hono dependency to 4.13.0, fixing GHSA-8j4g-w8fx-2239 (CORS middleware ReDoS).


## [3.1.0] - 2026-08-03

### Changed
- Added a portable CLIProxyAPI account provider with health, account inventory, and utilization support in `ops-accounts`.
- Standardized CLIProxyAPI discovery across `CLIPROXYAPI_AUTH_DIR`, `CLIPROXYAPI_HOME`, and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, with explicit environment configuration for optional proxy endpoints.
- Hardened release automation with required CI and CodeQL checks, bounded GitHub queries, stable-head verification, and exact-SHA squash merges without branch-protection bypass.
- Updated `ip-address` from 10.2.0 to 10.4.0 in the plugin and Telegram server dependency trees.
- Updated Telegram server `fast-uri` from 3.1.4 to 3.1.5, including the upstream security fix.
- Preserved existing release notes during first-time and interrupted GitHub wiki synchronization.
- Fixed gateway execution through symlinked or canonical paths and added a clear 503 response when the optional Grok endpoint is not configured.
- Removed ShellCheck warnings from the touched account and release commands.
- Removed deployment-specific browser login, CAPTCHA, reauthentication, and subscription automation from the public plugin.


## [3.0.0] - 2026-08-03

### Changed
Upgraded @hono/node-server to 2.0.12 for security and performance fixes, and aligned the Telegram server minimum runtime to Node.js 20+ (#771).


## [2.48.0] - 2026-08-03

### Changed
Added a portable public configuration contract and sanitizer with regression coverage for private identifiers and service URLs.

### Changed
fix(ops-inbox): enforce live sent-check and auto-heal app-state on archive


## [2.47.8] - 2026-07-30

### Changed
- **Keep `current/.in_use`:** 2.47.6 cleared both `.orphaned_at` and `.in_use` from `current/` after the refresh. Clearing `.in_use` was wrong — every session that resolves `current/` as its plugin root registers its own live PID there, and that registry is what stops the sweeper deleting `current/` under a running session if `installPath` moves off it. Only the orphan marker is cleared now; excluding `.in_use` from the rsync already keeps the version directory's dead PIDs out.


## [2.47.7] - 2026-07-30

### Changed
Companion detection now follows symlinks. is_installed used plain find, which does not descend into a symlinked directory, so boxes that keep ~/.claude/skills on another volume read every companion there as missing. ops-update retried the install each run and reported 'fail: gsd install' while GSD was in fact installed.


## [2.47.6] - 2026-07-30

### Changed
- **Plugin cache markers:** `ops-post-update-migrate` no longer copies Claude Code's cache-GC bookkeeping (`.orphaned_at`, `.in_use`) from the version directory into `current/`. A copied marker is already past its grace period, so once `installPath` moved off `current/` the CLI would delete it on the next sweep while live sessions still resolved `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` through it — the stale-plugin-root failure `current/` exists to prevent.
- **Atomic installed_plugins.json write:** the file is now written through a temp file and renamed instead of truncated in place. Every installed plugin resolves through it, so a crash or a concurrent reader mid-write broke all of them, not just ops. The rename preserves the original 0600 mode.


## [2.47.5] - 2026-07-30

### Changed
Remove the dependencies key from plugin.json. Claude Code reads it as an array of plugins to auto-install; we stored our own object there, so the manifest failed validation and /plugin listed ops as an error. Companion installs are unaffected - plugin-dependencies.json is the SSOT and already lists all five.


## [2.47.4] - 2026-07-30

### Changed
Fix cursor-agent marketplace update no-op: companion CLI sync now always uses remove+add for Cursor, ensuring the plugin cache doesn't silently stay pinned to a stale commit.


## [2.47.3] - 2026-07-30

### Changed
ops-update now auto-syncs Grok and Cursor plugin caches to the latest version, pruning stale copies, as part of every local upgrade.


## [2.47.2] - 2026-07-30

### Changed
### Fixed
- \`ops-post-update-migrate\` no longer leaves \`current/\` as a dangling symlink. If a legacy or dangling symlink was already at \`current/\` (e.g. left pointing at a version \`ops-update\`'s prune step just deleted), the rsync refresh now strips it first instead of silently failing against it.


## [2.47.1] - 2026-07-30

### Changed
### Fixed
- \`ops-update\` now refreshes the marketplace catalogue for real under \`--dry-run\`, instead of only printing the command. A dry-run right after a new release previously reported the target version as unchanged until a manual \`claude plugin marketplace update\` was run first.


## [2.47.0] - 2026-07-30

### Changed
### Added
- desktop-act companion: virtual desktop control MCP (co-installed with ops)
- ops-accounts: multi-provider seat/rotation router (Claude/Grok/OpenAI/Factory/Cursor), CRS-optional dual-mode backend
- account-rotation: captcha-solving cascade for standalone rotation and magic-link reauth flows, portable unattended reauth env

### Fixed
- security: replaced shell-string execSync calls with execFileSync argument arrays
- ops-accounts: route gateway/seats/util through shell before Node CLI
- hea: Paperclip→Linear create-guard + terminal status skip
- watchdog: expand ${VAR} in config headers before probing
- account-rotation: keep CRS harness for agents TUI

### Changed
- deps: bump prettier and playwright

## [2.46.1] - 2026-07-24

### Changed
ops-inbox: per-channel Workflow fan-out is now the default posture; draft text prints inline in chat, not just in the AskUserQuestion preview pane.

- fix(crs): restore accountProxyConfig export in crs-pool-config.mjs (#689)
- chore(deps): bump the npm_and_yarn group across 1 directory with 3 updates (#688)


## [2.44.0] - 2026-07-21

### Changed
Adds installer/ subdir — a Node ESM package (`npx claude-ops-installer install`) that mirrors upstream skills + binstubs into Claude Code / Codex / Gemini CLI / OpenClaw / Hermes / OpenCode from a single central config. Central config at ~/.config/claude-ops-installer/config.yaml. Subcommands: install / update / verify / doctor / uninstall / agents. Surgical uninstall via ~/.cache/claude-ops-installer/manifest.json. Refuses to overwrite real files without --force; never touches Claude's marketplace plugin cache. Public-repo clean.

Also fixes pre-existing lint + bash-n failures on v2.43.0 surfaces (windsor fixture, ops-slack/stripe/telegram-autolink parens, package.json test script shebang filter), and adds Agent Teams compliance scaffolding to ops-desk so test-agent-teams.sh passes.


## [2.43.0] - 2026-07-20

### Changed
### Added
- **ops-desk (new skill):** `/ops:ops-desk` desk sweep — fans out read-only context agents (batched 3-wide via the Workflow tool) over the owner's open decisions, staged drafts, payments, sign-offs and chases, returning a ranked ready-to-approve action queue worked down under the per-draft outbound gate. Sister command to `/ops:ops-inbox`.
- **ops-ecom:** `channels` | `agentic` | `shop` verbs — sales channel inventory, agentic storefront health, Shop Campaigns readiness (read-only; Rule 5 / stage-only spend).
- **ops-marketing:** brand-agnostic `shop_campaigns` + `agentic_storefronts` project prefs schema; `shop-campaigns` / `agentic` routing; portfolio awareness; NEVER LEAK MONEY guardrails for Shop Campaigns.


## [2.42.0] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
### Added
- `/ops-ecom`: new `channels`, `agentic`, and `shop` probes — publications/sales-channel inventory, Shopify Agentic storefronts (AI commerce) health, and Shop channel + Shop Campaigns readiness (read-only)
- `/ops-marketing`: `shopify`, `shop_campaigns`, and `agentic_storefronts` preferences (cred-refs only) with routing, portfolio awareness, and stage-only spend guardrails — never auto-creates budgets


## [2.41.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- Direct channel wiring: a free direct-API fallback for Windsor.ai, with a new organic-metrics aggregator that pulls marketing metrics straight from channel APIs when Windsor is unavailable or over quota
- Marketing setup guide and integration docs covering direct channel wiring and when the fallback engages
- Test coverage for the organic-metrics aggregator and Windsor quota-message handling

### Changed
- Windsor.ai data-sanity check now detects quota/plan-limit text rows returned inside HTTP 200 responses, so exhausted plans are flagged instead of treated as valid data
- ops-dash, ops-ecom, ops-marketing, ops-socials, and ops-settings skills updated to surface the direct-channel fallback


## [2.40.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- Windsor.ai data-sanity check that detects silent all-zero metric responses (e.g. after a plan expiry) instead of reporting them as healthy data, with test fixtures and integration docs
- Marketing-data sanity guard wired into the dashboard, e-commerce, marketing, and socials skills so stale/empty Windsor feeds are flagged before metrics are presented


## [2.39.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- MCP watchdog now runs authenticated probes and dispatches a headless fix agent to repair unhealthy servers automatically, replacing vague failure notifications.
- Email draft cron supports Omnisend as a provider.

### Fixed
- Email draft cron correctly handles stdin input and strips markdown code fences from generated drafts.
- Competitor intel cron uses the correct `--system-prompt` flag (the `claude` CLI has no `--system` flag).


## [2.38.6] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
ops-inbox: Paperclip SSOT scan + mandatory WA archive API (PR #670)


## [2.38.5] - 2026-07-18

### Changed
ops-inbox: require gog raw SENT labelIds verification (in:sent search polluted); already_replied? on KEEP rows


## [2.38.4] - 2026-06-30

### Changed
### Fixed
- Passed the CRS admin environment through token-feed-triggered priority ticks so manual or timer feed runs can close quota-capped accounts reliably.


## [2.38.3] - 2026-06-30

### Changed
### Fixed
- Prevented CRS token feed health resets from reopening accounts that quota policy intentionally marked unschedulable.


## [2.38.2] - 2026-06-30

### Changed
### Fixed
- Preserved CRS account schedulable state and routing metadata when token feed refreshes OAuth credentials.
- Kept weekly utilization caps as hard-off conditions so the conservative priority floor does not reopen exhausted accounts.


## [2.38.1] - 2026-06-28

### Changed
Publish /ops:ops-mac macOS diagnose-and-fix command (skill + bin/ops-mac dispatcher bundling the macos-toolkit CLI suite).


## [2.38.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added
ops-mac: new `/ops:ops-mac` skill + `bin/ops-mac` dispatcher — a unified macOS diagnose-and-fix command center that bundles the [macos-toolkit](https://github.com/lu-zhengda/macos-toolkit) CLI suite (machealth, netwhiz, pstop, macdog, lanchr, macbroom, macctl, macfig, updater) behind one entrypoint. Self-installs the suite on first use (plugin marketplace + Homebrew tap), runs a read-only aggregate audit (security, launch agents, processes, network, disk, system health), and applies guarded fixes (firewall, stale daemons, cache cleanup) with per-action confirmation (Rule 5). Hardened against two toolkit quirks: machealth's hang-prone composite probe is timeout-guarded, and headless TTY-empty table rendering is bypassed via forced `--json`. macOS-only (exits cleanly elsewhere; complements cross-platform `/ops:speedup`).

## [2.36.5] - 2026-06-28

### Changed
ops-yolo: always consolidate the four C-suite analyses into one master executive-summary.md per run (TL;DR, consensus action, cross-cutting themes, prioritized auto/confirm action list); per-officer files become supporting detail.


## [2.37.0] - 2026-06-28

### Changed
Add Sonos audio control to ops-home: registers the local Sonos toolchain (soco-cli, @svrooij/sonos-cli, steipete Go CLI, node-sonos-http-api bridge, sonos-ts-mcp MCP server) as reusable, agent-invokable capabilities with play/pause/volume/group/discover routing.


## [2.36.4] - 2026-06-28

### Changed
Remove stale ledger skill


## [2.36.3] - 2026-06-28

### Changed
Fixed: claude-ops-daemon.service now loads the gog file-keyring env via EnvironmentFile (mcp-secrets.env), so memory-extractor can decrypt Gmail OAuth tokens and collect email. Resolves silent "gog returned no data — nothing to extract" skips on headless Linux installs (#636).


## [2.36.2] - 2026-06-24

### Changed
CRS config-driven pool scheduler, max-out policy option, token-feed and remote tunnel fixes


## [2.36.1] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- CRS routing guardrails for multi-account rotation across Mac and remote hosts — a Bedrock fallback guard hook, token feed, health watch, route-state tracking, and the `claude-stack` helper, with systemd units and a remote-relay tunnel installer to keep sessions on the right account.

### Changed
- Upgraded headless agents (build-fixer, deploy-fixer, dependency-auditor, monitor-agent, memory-extractor) to Sonnet.

### Fixed
- `claude-invoke` now authenticates correctly against CRS.
- Pocket env broker peer authentication on macOS now uses `LOCAL_PEERCRED`.
- Corrected contact registry deduplication, Gmail flag placement, and todo label matching in the inbox/contact tooling.


## [2.36.0] - 2026-06-22

### Changed
ops-inbox: never archive todo/action-labeled emails until verified done (HARD GUARDRAIL); tone/language matching per contact; full-context cross-channel + already-sent dedup; snooze/follow-up intelligence so commitments & meeting-note todos are never lost; safe autonomous chores (archive already-replied, schedule reminders) with the Rule-6 outbound gate intact; new bin/ops-contact-registry offline cross-channel contact registry (build/lookup/stats).


## [2.35.0] - 2026-06-22

### Changed
Add ops-feature-dev skill routing to /feature-dev; fix plugin:agent namespace resolution in ops-suggest-specialized-agent; wire feature-dev into /flow and /ops:setup Step 2c.


## [2.34.1] - 2026-06-15

### Changed
### Fixed
- `ops-bg` now injects the CRS routing overlay (`--settings ~/.claude/crs-session-settings.json`) into every background session it spawns, so they inherit the sanctioned relay routing instead of going direct. Previously this was only patched in the installed plugin-cache copy and was lost on each plugin upgrade; it now lives in the canonical source. Includes a preflight that refuses to spawn on a half-set overlay or 401-rejected key. Opt out with `CRS_OVERLAY=""`.


## [2.34.0] - 2026-06-15

### Changed
Bedrock cost protection + fleet dashboard. Adds a configurable bedrock-billing-guard PreToolUse hook (block/warn/off) that halts any agent measured billing metered AWS Bedrock until explicit ack, plus offender-flag wiring in the rotation watchdog. Promotes the read-only fleet dashboard to /ops:ops-fleet with CRS-port/allowlist/429-529/session-count fixes.


## [2.33.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- `ops-sync-docs` helper to reconcile documentation counts (now 57 commands / 21 agents) and keep the wiki in sync.
- AI-generated changelog support in the release flow, with automatic doc-sync and wiki maintenance.

### Fixed
- Bedrock leak watchdog now catches runtime-injected and network-only Bedrock usage that previously slipped through.
- Account rotation no longer falls back to Bedrock and preserves CRS routing across mode flips; box-live daemon behaviors are reconciled into the tracked daemon.
- Stored OAuth tokens are invalidated on a 401 from `/oauth/usage`, preventing stale-credential loops.
- CRS priority daemon health-gate now auto-detects the CRS host port instead of assuming a fixed one.
- Post-update migration uses a stable `current/` directory, eliminating stale plugin-path errors after upgrades.


## [2.32.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- CRS relay-pool auto-prioritization: a new `crs-priority` daemon (opt-in, off by default) that manages per-account `schedulable` flags on a claude-relay-service pool from live signals (`sessionWindowStatus` + rate-limit + overload, with `claudeUsage` utilization as a fresh-only secondary), so the relay avoids near-maxed accounts and re-enables them on recovery — the relay-pool analogue of the keychain rotator. Hysteresis bands prevent flapping; a floor guarantees the pool never starves itself; stale/absent usage never drives a re-enable. Ships `scripts/account-rotation/crs-priority-daemon.{mjs,sh}`, a `templates/com.claude-ops.crs-priority.plist` launchd template + `scripts/install-crs-priority-agent.sh` installer (120s cadence, single-flight locked), a `crs` config block, and wires `/ops:rotate crs|crs-tick` (status/manual tick) + an `/ops:rotate-setup --crs` install step. Admin password resolves from `$CRS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` or the credential store (`CRS-Admin-<adminUser>`), never config.
- `ops-update`: a new step fast-forwards a linked local source checkout's `main` to `origin/main` after the cache upgrade, so a dev clone never silently drifts behind the published release. Safe by construction — it acts only when the checkout is on a clean `main` (never clobbering uncommitted WIP, a feature branch, or unpushed commits) and is a no-op when no checkout is present. New `--no-localsync` flag opts out.

### Fixed

- `ops-post-update-migrate`: rsync each new version into a stable `current/` directory and repoint `installed_plugins.json` at it, so Claude Code deleting the old versioned cache dir mid-session no longer triggers "Plugin directory does not exist" PostToolUse hook errors. All steps are non-fatal guards.

## [2.31.0] - 2026-06-14

### Changed

Rotation: never use Bedrock while any OAuth (Claude Max) account has a usable token. Adds provider-env model/AWS-var scrub on provider swap (no more invalid Bedrock model id leaking into OAuth sessions), bedrock-lease purge on OAuth recovery, a live-session Bedrock force-swap watchdog (no defer for metered spend) with ss-based bedrock-runtime network scanner, and default-off post-swap continuation injection (PR #582).

## [2.30.5] - 2026-06-14

### Changed

Fix ops-update step-6 version-path rewrite on macOS/BSD: `sed -i -E` consumed `-E` as the -i backup suffix (extended regex off → `\1` undefined → silent rewrite failure). Switched to a portable temp-file rewrite that works on BSD + GNU sed.

## [2.30.4] - 2026-06-14

### Changed

telegram channel-mcp: env-templated single-owner leader gate (PID -> DEVBOT_TELEGRAM_OWNER) with TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_POLL opt-out; fix ops-deploy-monitor missing deploy-fix-common source; prettier account-rotation scripts

## [2.30.3] - 2026-06-14

### Changed

Remove per-session stdio MCP servers (telegram, telegram-channel, doppler, desktop-act) from plugin .mcp.json — they loaded once per Claude session, multiplying processes across all live sessions. telegram was dead (empty creds); doppler + desktop-act relocated to on-demand (mcp-toggle). Daemon telegram-notification and doppler CLI secret-resolution paths are unaffected. MCP cost no longer scales with session count.

## [2.30.2] - 2026-06-14

### Changed

Privacy/templating pass: scrubbed all personal data from source + history (generic placeholders), removed project-specific scripts. New: provider-router (hot per-request provider/account swap via ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL) + daemon Bedrock→OAuth drift self-heal.

## [2.29.1] - 2026-06-12

### Changed

- fix(ops): cross-platform gh-orphan-killer for curl/api.github.com poll loops + live installer (#558)
- fix(wa-mac-archive): owner-idle gate + precise Archive-chat matching + focus restore (#562)

## [2.29.0] - 2026-06-11

### Changed

ops-inbox: Mac WhatsApp.app fallback suite — Tier-4 archive via Mac app (bypasses server-side 429), automatic Mac ground-truth cross-check in the freshness gate, and Tailscale→Cloudflare-tunnel SSH transport chain (wa-mac-transport.sh + setup-wa-mac-cf-tunnel.sh) (#560)

## [2.28.0] - 2026-06-11

### Changed

ops-inbox: Mac WhatsApp.app ChatStorage fallback for bridge-miss recovery (read-only reader + freshness-gate hint).

## [2.27.4] - 2026-06-11

### Changed

WA bridge Fix V: tolerate missing sync keys in LTHash skip loop, 300ms throttle (dodges 429 rate-overlimit), key-arrival poller; default skip_bad=true on full_sync resync. Verified end-to-end 2026-06-10: poisoned regular_low chain healed, archive writes propagate to phone (31/31). Upstream: tulir/whatsmeow#1171.

## [2.27.3] - 2026-06-09

### Changed

WhatsApp inbox-scan resilience: corrupt archived flag can no longer blind the scan (recency fallback, #545); full_sync resync defaults skip_bad=true so wedged LTHash chains self-heal, ops-inbox heal recipes updated (#546).

## [2.27.2] - 2026-06-09

### Changed

ops-inbox-scan: treat WhatsApp as remote-only when no local store — signal the orchestrator to scan via live MCP (mcp**whatsapp**\*) instead of reporting empty buckets as 'no messages'. Prevents stale/de-paired local stores from producing phantom needs_reply and duplicate sends.

## [2.27.1] - 2026-06-09

### Changed

fix(whatsapp): /api/archive now re-pulls the recovered regular_low snapshot between 409-conflict retries so inbox archiving converges without a manual recover→retry; fails fast on a persistently unverifiable server chain instead of burning repeated full-snapshot resyncs (NEVER-LEAK guard) (Fix V, #541).

## [2.27.0] - 2026-06-08

### Changed

feat(ops): Windsor.ai live marketing/analytics data source — 325+ connectors (Meta Ads, Google Ads, GA4, TikTok, LinkedIn, …) for /ops:marketing, /ops:socials, /ops:ecom, /ops:dash, via MCP (OAuth) or REST (#534). fix(account-rotation): jitter the post-rotation fan-out — random jitter on the respawn stagger (#536) and the /login session-inject cadence (#538) so a freshly-rotated account isn't hit by a synchronized first-call burst. fix(scripts): content + SEO generators work under macOS bash 3.2 / printf leading-dash (#535). docs: README rotation anti-stampede + Windsor.ai notes (#539).

## [2.26.5] - 2026-06-07

### Changed

Security hardening: independent pii-gate CI job + owner-PII checks in test-no-secrets.sh (home paths, webmail/brand emails, AWS ARN account ids, phone numbers) so personal data can never land in this public repo again (#530); gitleaks false-positives allowlisted so secret-scan CI is genuinely green/enforcing (#532).

## [2.26.4] - 2026-06-07

### Changed

WhatsApp bridge: Fix T skips unverifiable LTHash app-state patches instead of wedging archive sync (ends the re-pair treadmill); Fix U reconciles chats.archived from whatsmeow_chat_settings so the box mirrors the phone with no re-pair. New endpoints: /api/resync_app_state?skip_bad=true, /api/reconcile_archived.

## [2.26.3] - 2026-06-07

### Changed

Account rotation now re-auths live TTY sessions (tmux/iTerm2 /login injection + resume-path for non-tmux interactive sessions like Ghostty) in addition to respawning detached bg agents (#527). Protect Supercharge from /speedup demotion; gitignore .gstack/.

## [2.26.2] - 2026-06-07

### Changed

fix(daemon): Linux/systemd status detection in ops-daemon-manager (installed/running/pid now correct on systemd --user hosts, not just macOS launchd); real whatsapp-bridge PID reporting via optional registry pid_probe field (reporting-only, never fed into liveness/restart path).

## [2.26.1] - 2026-06-07

### Changed

fix(whatsapp): durable post-re-pair app-state LTHash prevention — readiness gate on /api/archive (HTTP 425 until regular_low synced), new /api/app_state_status, discard_local resync to heal corruption without a phone tap, and wa-inbox-fresh freshness wait (#521). feat(whatsapp): auto-backfill chat display names in link_contacts.py so LID/phone chats never show raw numbers (#520).

## [2.26.0] - 2026-06-06

### Changed

Add /ops:ops-unifi UniFi network command center + ops:unifi-agent probe agent. Curl-native control across all three official UniFi APIs — Site Manager (cloud api.ui.com: hosts, sites, devices, ISP/WAN metrics, SD-WAN), Network Integration (local proxy/network/integration/v1: devices, clients, restart, block/unblock, vouchers, live stats), and Protect Integration (local proxy/protect/integration/v1: cameras, NVR, snapshot, settings). Includes a predict mode that cross-correlates ISP metrics + device stats + camera state to flag WAN degradation, AP stress, weak-RF clients, and surveillance gaps. Adds a /ops:setup network wizard section; all state-changing actions Rule-5 gated, outbound alerts Rule-6 gated.

## [2.25.0] - 2026-06-06

### Changed

WhatsApp ops-inbox: project the HistorySync per-conversation archive flag onto chats.archived so the inbox view mirrors the phone independent of the chronically-corrupt regular_low app-state (Fix O); request maximum history on (re-)pair via RequireFullSync + maxed history-sync limits (Fix P).

## [2.24.0] - 2026-06-06

### Changed

Add /ops:ops-ar A&R command + ar-producer agent (Opus): runs the audio-ar stack (BPM/key/loudness/structure, stems, CLAP mood/genre/hit-lean, Whisper lyrics, Cyanite/Music.ai pro layer) and delivers verdict cards. Modes: single track, batch, full Gmail-inbox demo sweep; emails the full verdict with direct listen links (Rule 6 gated).

## [2.23.1] - 2026-06-06

### Changed

Balanced model strategy for gstack skills and ops commands

## [2.23.0] - 2026-06-05

### Changed

First-class WhatsApp media enrichment (video/image/document via vision+whisper) + bridge media-retry self-heal for 403/404/410 (Fix M), whatsmeow API-drift sync (Fix N + A/B/D/F/G/I ctx), and pinned whatsmeow in the installer to fix the @latest broken-build.

## [2.22.0] - 2026-06-05

### Changed

- ops-inbox: seed merged DM groups with lid twins from whatsmeow_lid_map (#504)
- ops: add telegram_bot_token/owner_id to plugin schema; bump yolo agent turns (#503)
- deps: bump hono (#499)
- dispatch: strip ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from all claude agent spawns (#497)

## [2.21.0] - 2026-06-05

### Changed

ops-inbox: autonomous WhatsApp refresh + send-log reconciliation on every scan. ops-inbox-scan now blocks (bounded) on a backfill+settle so classification reads a converged store, and reconciles the bridge outbound-send journal to auto-demote NEEDS_REPLY threads already answered via /api/send or a phone send not yet in the store. Closes the race where the background autosync hook left the scan reading stale data.

## [2.20.14] - 2026-06-04

### Changed

fix(ops-doctor): suppress non-actionable INFO for keys covered by global MCP; remove retired Kapture nag; widen stale-threshold to 2x interval to eliminate jitter false positives

## [2.20.13] - 2026-06-04

### Changed

- salvage-scan: single-instance lock, hard timeout, bounded gh calls, nice priority (#494)
- desktop-act-launcher: document macOS as a first-class native backend (#493)
- scope Claude Code-credentials keychain lookup to $USER account (#492)
- add Claude Code GitHub Action workflow (#491)

## [2.20.12] - 2026-06-03

### Changed

ops-rotate-setup: delegate OAuth capture to rotate.mjs (Turnstile-capable browser-driver cascade) and write the consumed `Claude-Rotation-<key>`/`$USER` keychain schema; rewrite setup-account.mjs as a thin wrapper over `rotate.mjs --setup --only=<email> --auto --skip-valid`; update SKILL.md token-check, keychain references, and failure modes to match. The prior implementation launched a fresh Playwright Chromium (blocked by Cloudflare Turnstile, so the magic link was never sent) and wrote a sessionKey cookie under a keychain coordinate no consumer reads.

### Fixed

ops-release: CHANGELOG prepend now passes the multi-line section to awk via a temp file (`getline`), fixing the `awk: newline in string` error that silently skipped the changelog entry when `--notes` spanned multiple lines.

## [2.20.11] - 2026-06-03

### Changed

Stop ops-daemon falsely churning whatsapp-bridge. check_health/write_daemon_health now honor the configured `health_check` probe (e.g. `lsof -i :8080`) as authoritative liveness instead of tracking the ephemeral launcher-wrapper PID that exits as soon as the systemd-owned bridge is up — eliminating perpetual 'HEALTH: whatsapp-bridge is dead → RESTART' log spam, inflated restart counters and false max_restarts crash alerts for a healthy bridge. The probe-command lookup caches only on a clean parse so a transient config-read failure can't permanently disable it. Services without a `health_check` keep the legacy PID-liveness behavior.

## [2.20.9] - 2026-06-03

### Changed

Telegram channel-mcp leader-exclusive poll+reply gate (#481): only the fleet-orchestrator leader session consumes the bot, preventing multi-session getUpdates contention; fails open for non-fleet / non-Linux installs so default single-session behavior is preserved.

## [2.20.8] - 2026-06-02

### Changed

whatsapp-mcp: port apply-patches.py Fix A/B pairing + C/D/F/G/L to current upstream whatsmeow API (go build/vet clean); recover_app_state now resync-only (peer-recovery API removed upstream) (PR #479)

## [2.20.7] - 2026-06-02

### Changed

whatsapp-mcp: re-anchor apply-patches.py Fix E/H/J against current upstream + move sentinels onto invariant content (PR #477)

## [2.20.6] - 2026-06-02

### Changed

whatsapp-mcp: self-installing archive_chat via healing /api/archive (Fix M, PR #475); email: account-safe gog-reply helper (PR #474)

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- fix(whatsapp-mcp): port apply-patches.py Fix A/B (pairing) and Fix C/D (`FetchAppState`) to the current upstream + pinned-whatsmeow API — these were genuine API/behaviour drift, not anchor bit-rot, so a fresh reinstall failed to apply and/or failed to compile (`go build`/`go vet` errored). Verified signatures against whatsmeow `v0.0.0-20250318233852-06705625cf82` via `go doc`/source. Changes:
  - **Fix A/B (pairing):** upstream switched to **QR-only** login (no `PairPhone` call to anchor on). `Client.PairPhone` still exists in the pinned whatsmeow, so per "prefer phone-pair when supported" the patcher now **re-introduces phone-number (pairing-code) linking** into upstream's QR block — `WA_PHONE` set → pairing code; unset → QR loop unchanged. `PairPhone` also **lost its `context.Context` parameter** (`PairPhone(phone, showPushNotification, clientType, clientDisplayName)`), so Fix B's old `context.WithTimeout` deadline can't be passed in; the 3-minute hang-bound is preserved by racing `PairPhone` in a goroutine against a `time.After` watchdog. Fix A's 3s post-`Connect` sleep retained. New sentinel keys on inserted-content invariant. Also dropped the old hardcoded fallback phone number (now `os.Getenv("WA_PHONE")` only).
  - **Fix C/D + F/G (`FetchAppState`/`SendAppState`):** current whatsmeow **dropped the `context.Context` first arg** from `FetchAppState(name, fullSync, onlyIfNotSynced)` and `SendAppState(patch)` — `go vet` reported "too many arguments". Updated all four call sites (Fix D resync endpoint, Fix G `healLTHash`, Fix F `/api/archive`). Fix C (`StoreMessage`/`StoreChat` outbound persistence) already matched upstream and is unchanged.
  - **⚠️ BEHAVIOUR CHANGE — Fix L `recover_app_state` degraded:** the pinned whatsmeow **removed the public primary-device peer-recovery path** — `whatsmeow.BuildAppStateRecoveryRequest` no longer exists and `SendPeerMessage` is now only an unexported `DangerousInternals()` method. `sendRecoveryAndBackfill` can no longer ask the phone for an unencrypted snapshot to **bypass a corrupt server patch chain** (#382/#858). It now logs that loudly and falls back to a best-effort **full server-side resync** (`FetchAppState(name, true, false)`) + backfill — which re-applies the server chain but **cannot recover a fatally-unverifiable one**. To restore true peer-recovery, pin a whatsmeow that still exports those APIs. Documented in `ENDPOINTS.md`. **Owner decision needed:** accept resync-only recovery, or pin an older whatsmeow.
  - Verified: fresh upstream clone → all four (+F/G) apply once; `go mod download && go build ./... && go vet ./...` PASS (were 5 errors before); rerun → all `[skip]` (idempotent); live-tree copy → no duplicate insertions, build clean; `py_compile` + `tests/test-no-secrets.sh` clean; no real phone number in the diff. Live install untouched (source-only patcher change).
- fix(whatsapp-mcp): apply-patches.py Fix M makes the `archive_chat` + `resync_app_state` MCP surface self-contained — current upstream lharries/whatsapp-mcp ships none of it, so a fresh reinstall left the MCP server with no working `archive_chat`. The MCP tool now durably routes through the healing `POST /api/archive` endpoint (auto-recovers LTHash 409s, whatsmeow #382/#858) instead of a raw app-state mutation. Idempotent against both pristine upstream and already-patched live trees (no duplicate defs on rerun). ENDPOINTS.md documents the heal routing.
- fix(whatsapp-mcp): re-anchor apply-patches.py Fix E, Fix H (`*events.Archive` subscriber) and Fix J (`list_chats` archived filter) against current upstream. Their needles had bit-rotted — upstream reflowed whitespace (collapsed a blank line before `get_sender_name`, trailing space after the `SELECT` keyword, blank-line indentation in `list_chats`), dropped trailing commas (last `list_chats` param, last `Chat()` kwarg) and changed the `events.LoggedOut` log string — so a fresh reinstall silently skipped all three (`needle not found`), leaving the bridge with no archive-event subscriber and the MCP server with no `archived` column/filter. Re-anchored each splice to a minimal stable nearby token (e.g. `def get_sender_name`, `case *events.LoggedOut:`, `…last_is_from_me\n            FROM chats`) and moved the Fix E / Fix J-row sentinels onto the inserted content's invariant (`def _open_db(`, `archived=bool(chat_data[6])`) so they no-op on the older-patcher-patched live tree instead of duplicating the helper. Inserted content (runtime behaviour) is unchanged. Verified: fresh upstream → all apply once; rerun → all skip; live-tree copy → no duplicate insertions; gofmt + py_compile clean. (Out of scope, flagged: Fix A/B PairPhone and Fix C/D no longer match upstream either — upstream switched to QR pairing and changed `FetchAppState`/send shapes; those are behaviour/API drifts, not just bit-rot.)

## [2.20.5] - 2026-06-02

### Changed

ops-inbox: act on finance/legal/personal threads instead of surface-only (PR #472)

## [2.20.4] - 2026-06-02

### Changed

ops-inbox: INBOX ZERO is now the mandate — archive everything not actionable (incl. WAITING, auto-resurfaces), auto-archive immediately after replying, include_context:true hard default on every read, verify bridge fully up first, and the verified phone archive-toggle heal for the /api/archive LTHash hang.

## [2.20.3] - 2026-06-02

### Changed

add telegram_bot_token/owner_id to plugin userConfig schema (telegram-channel MCP); bump yolo maxTurns 20→35

## [2.20.2] - 2026-06-02

### Changed

- fix(ops-inbox): seed merged DM groups with lid twins from whatsmeow_lid_map (#466)

## [2.20.1] - 2026-06-02

### Changed

ops-inbox: fix gog archive/verify (raw not cached search); add open-tracking follow-up feature

## [2.20.0] - 2026-06-02

### Changed

### Added

- Pocket/email-cos Telegram approvals now render A/B/C options with a ⭐ recommended pick, a decision-question header, and untruncated message bodies (full email drafts + voice-memo context) (#459).
- Freeform email **edit → re-draft → re-stage**: replying to an email approval with edits (e.g. "change the date to Friday") re-drafts the body via LLM and re-stages a fresh approval ASK; the original draft is never auto-sent (#462).

### Fixed

- Every `claude -p` subprocess in pocket-responder (`_redraft_email`, `_llm_map`, `_validate_action`) was silently dying with "Prompt is too long" on context-heavy boxes — added MCP-isolation flags (`--strict-mcp-config --mcp-config '{}'`) so freeform natural-language approval mapping and the pre-send validation guard actually work, not just the regex fast-path (#462).

## [2.19.3] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- feat(ops-ship): one-command sweep-merge-all-PRs → release → update (#457)

## [2.19.2] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

feat(ops-release): register /ops:ops-release slash command (#455); fix(whatsapp): canonicalize 180s restart-floor in wa-inbox-fresh + wa-bridge-keepalive so it survives reinstall (#454)

## [2.19.1] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

- feat(ops-update): one-command local plugin upgrade with prune + version-rewrite (#450)
- fix(ops-dash): align box right-borders via display-width-aware padding (#449)

## [2.18.20] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

ops-inbox: offline scan engine replaces the ~330k-token agent fan-out.

(The ops-inbox-scan feature landed on main after the sibling v2.18.19 release tag was cut, so it ships here as 2.18.20.)

- bin/ops-inbox-scan: deterministic read-only classifier — WhatsApp (whatsmeow sqlite, lid<->phone merge into one conversation, names from contacts, mode=ro WAL-safe, archived=0 filter / no recency cutoff) + Email (gog gmail search envelope first-pass + no-reply-sender heuristic). ~0.9s, near-zero tokens.
- ops-inbox SKILL.md: bin/ops-inbox-scan is now the PRIMARY scan engine; the Workflow fan-out is demoted to a fallback for channels with real per-thread volume the script can't reach. Slack + Telegram become one light inline MCP call each (no subagent).
- Fix the fan-out's 'args.map is not a function' crash via defensive JSON.parse.

Net: the common WhatsApp + email + glance case drops from 5 agents / ~330k tokens / ~130s to a sub-second script + a couple of inline calls.

## [2.18.19] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

Re-release of the ops-inbox offline scan engine (supersedes the orphaned v2.18.19 tag, which was cut at 01:30 from a commit predating bin/ops-inbox-scan).

- bin/ops-inbox-scan: deterministic read-only classifier — WhatsApp (whatsmeow sqlite, lid<->phone merge, names from contacts, mode=ro WAL-safe, no recency cutoff) + Email (gog envelope first-pass). ~0.9s, near-zero tokens.
- ops-inbox SKILL.md: script is the PRIMARY scan engine; Workflow fan-out demoted to fallback; Slack + Telegram = one inline MCP call each.
- Fix the fan-out 'args.map is not a function' crash (defensive JSON.parse).

Net: common WhatsApp + email + glance case drops from 5 agents / ~330k tokens / ~130s to a sub-second script + a couple of inline calls.

## [2.18.19] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

ops-inbox: offline scan engine replaces the ~330k-token agent fan-out.

- New bin/ops-inbox-scan: deterministic, read-only, in-process classifier for the two heaviest channels — WhatsApp (direct whatsmeow sqlite read; merges each person's lid<->phone chats into one conversation; classifies needs_reply/waiting/groups/fyi from the true merged-thread last message; resolves names from contacts; ~0.9s) and Email (gog gmail search envelope first-pass + no-reply-sender heuristic). Opens the live DB mode=ro (not immutable=1) so WAL-buffered freshest messages aren't skipped; no hard recency cutoff (archived=0 is the filter).
- ops-inbox SKILL.md: ops-inbox-scan is now the PRIMARY scan engine; the Workflow fan-out is demoted to a fallback for channels with real per-thread volume the script can't reach. Slack + Telegram become one light inline MCP call each (no subagent).
- Fix the fan-out's 'args.map is not a function' crash via defensive JSON.parse (the harness can deliver args as a string).

Net: the common WhatsApp + email + glance case drops from 5 agents / ~330k tokens / ~130s to a sub-second script + a couple of inline calls.

## [2.18.19] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

Ship bin/ops-home snapshot producer (Homey Pro: power, alarms, presence, devices) so ops-go/ops-fires Home section resolves instead of 'home probe failed'. Project-aware ops-marketing-dash with owner-level channels.marketing Doppler-ref cred tier so the briefing Marketing section resolves My-Project GA4/Meta/Klaviyo. (Code merged via #443 without a version bump; this cuts the actual release.)

## [2.18.18] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

Bump Pocket webhook deps (fastapi 0.136.3, uvicorn 0.48.0); upgrade mcp-proxy to 0.12.0 on the box

## [2.18.17] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

Fix L: WhatsApp bridge phone-online prerequisite gate (recover/archive 503 when offline) + archive auto-retry on 409 conflict + recovery-with-backfill-on-alive

## [2.18.16] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

Ship Fix K: recover_app_state MCP tool canonicalized in apply-patches (15th mcp**whatsapp**\* tool); ENDPOINTS.md updated

## [2.18.15] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

CI: fix two pre-existing red suites blocking the merge gate. test-hooks.sh — add UserPromptSubmit + PreCompact to the valid hook-event allowlist (UserPromptSubmit is a real Claude Code event declared in hooks.json). test-agent-teams.sh — add Agent Teams boilerplate to the `flow` skill (TeamCreate + SendMessage in allowed-tools, '## Agent Teams support' section with flag check + example + fallback), matching every other agent-spawning skill. Full CI green for the first time.

## [2.18.14] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

Fix /ops:ops-go briefing empty Git/PRs/Infra/GSD sections — registry.json schema collision (GSD project schema vs old partner-template schema). New lib/registry-resolve.sh (null-guarded readers: repos from .remote_url, paths from .path, alias fallback) adopted by ops-git/ops-prs/ops-ci/ops-merge-scan/ops-dash; ops-merge-salvage-scan uses object-level derivation; ops-gsd-states matches the GSD-only registry (fixes empty GSD State); ops-infra reads ECS clusters from durable $OPS_DATA_DIR/infra.json (survives the twice-daily GSD sync + upgrades) with optional region. Audited all 20 registry consumers; 15 already tolerant/unrelated, no behavior change.

## [2.18.13] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- **WhatsApp: stop destructive `regular_low` auto-resync on Connected (#431).** The bridge
  ran `FetchAppState(regular_low, fullSync=true)` 3s after every connect, which on a fatally
  desynced collection (whatsmeow #382/#858) deleted the local snapshot and re-fetched the
  broken server patch chain — re-corrupting it on every restart and undoing `/api/recover_app_state`
  recovery. Now leaves `regular_low` untouched on connect; recover on demand only.

## [2.18.12] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- **WhatsApp `POST /api/recover_app_state` — fatal LTHash app-state recovery (#427, Fix I).**
  When the server's `regular_low` patch chain is unverifiable (`failed to verify patch vNNN:
mismatching LTHash`, whatsmeow #382/#858), archive/mute/pin 409 and neither resync, clearing
  the local snapshot, nor a single phone toggle heals it. The new endpoint requests a fresh
  unencrypted snapshot from the primary device (`BuildAppStateRecoveryRequest`→`SendPeerMessage`);
  whatsmeow's `handleAppStateRecovery` rebuilds the collection from scratch, bypassing the broken
  patches. Phone must be online. Verified end-to-end: `regular_low` rebuilt v621→v622, archive
  then succeeded.

## [2.18.11] - 2026-05-31

### Changed

WhatsApp /api/recover_app_state (#427) — fatal LTHash app-state recovery via primary-device snapshot; unblocks archive after a fatal patch-chain desync

## [2.18.11] - 2026-05-31

### Changed

WhatsApp /api/recover_app_state (#427) — fatal LTHash app-state recovery via primary-device snapshot; unblocks archive

## [2.18.11] - 2026-05-31

### Changed

WhatsApp bridge keepalive watchdog (#424) — hang-detection so phone-originated own-sends always sync

## [2.18.10] - 2026-05-31

### Changed

### Fixed

- Doppler MCP no longer fails to connect by default. Added `mcp-servers/doppler-launcher.sh`, which resolves `DOPPLER_TOKEN` (pasted config → inherited env → `doppler configure get token`) and never exports an empty token, so the server stops being force-failed when `doppler_token` is left blank (#422).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Doppler MCP no longer fails by default.** The server was wired with `DOPPLER_TOKEN: "${user_config.doppler_token}"`, and the `doppler_token` config defaults to `""` — so a blank value was passed to `npx doppler-mcp` as `DOPPLER_TOKEN=""`, clobbering any inherited token and forcing a "Not authenticated" exit (MCP showed "Failed to connect" on every box without a pasted token). The config description's promise — "leave blank — runtime resolves automatically" — was never actually implemented. Added `mcp-servers/doppler-launcher.sh`, which resolves the token from the pasted config value → inherited `DOPPLER_TOKEN` → `doppler configure get token` (a prior `doppler login`), and crucially never exports an empty `DOPPLER_TOKEN`. When no token resolves, the server starts with the var unset so it can use its own `doppler login` store instead of being force-failed.

## [2.18.9] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- `bin/ops-release` now bumps **package.json** (the `claude-ops-bin` npm package) in lockstep with plugin.json + the marketplace registry, so all version files stay in sync. Auto-detects package.json under `claude-ops/` or the repo root.

### Fixed

- Reconciled `claude-ops/package.json` version (was stuck at 2.15.0 because the prior release path never touched it) up to the current plugin version.

### Changed

- `RELEASE.md` documents the 4 version-bearing files and the package.json lockstep.

## 2.18.8 — 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- **WhatsApp: guard fts5 triggers behind a bridge-binary capability probe (#419).**
  `whatsapp-bridge-migrate.sh` created `messages_fts` fts5 triggers via the system
  sqlite3 CLI (which has fts5), so creation always succeeded — but the triggers fire
  on the **Go bridge's own inserts** using the bridge binary's embedded sqlite. A
  binary built without fts5 (old binary, `--skip-build`, or a CGO build missing
  `-tags sqlite_fts5`) then failed **every** insert with `no such module: fts5`,
  silently dropping messages (live + backfilled). Observed 2026-05-31: a pre-rebuild
  bridge dropped an entire midday conversation window. The migrate now probes
  `BRIDGE_BIN` for fts5 and only installs triggers when the binary can satisfy them;
  otherwise it drops any leftover fts schema (search → LIKE fallback, storage
  protected). `WHATSAPP_BRIDGE_BIN` env override added.

## 2.18.7 — 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- **ops-inbox: WhatsApp lid↔phone identity merge (#415).** whatsmeow stores the same
  person as two chats — `<lid>@lid` and `<pn>@s.whatsapp.net` — and the classifier scanned
  per-JID with no merge, so every run double-counted contacts (routinely **NEEDS_REPLY on
  one JID and WAITING on the other at once**), inflated counts, mis-prioritised, and read
  only half the person's history → drafts off a fragmented arc. Added a **blocking
  identity-merge step** to the FULL-THREAD AWARENESS GATE: map each JID via
  `whatsmeow_lid_map` (`store/whatsapp.db`; `contacts.phone` fallback), union both JIDs,
  sort by timestamp, classify on the merged thread's true last message, and read merged
  history for the arc + reply context. Also wired into the headless DB-fallback path and the
  parallel scan-engine WhatsApp steps. Recipe validated against the live store.

## 2.18.3 — 2026-05-31

### Added

- **WhatsApp voice-note auto-transcription.** New `scripts/whatsapp/transcribe_voice_notes.py`
  finds incoming voice notes (`media_type='audio'`, empty `content`), downloads them via the
  bridge `/api/download`, transcribes with OpenAI `whisper-1`, and writes `[voice] <text>`
  back into `messages.content` — **only** where content is still empty, so it never clobbers
  real text and is fully idempotent. Run by a new `whatsapp-transcribe.{service,timer}`
  (systemd-user, every 10 min + 2 min after boot), so voice notes appear in `ops-inbox`
  scans exactly like text. Cost-safe: `mkdir`-based single-instance lock, `--max` per-run
  cap on the metered Whisper API, and idempotent updates (never re-bills a row).
- **Pre-scan freshness gate** `bin/wa-inbox-fresh.sh`, installed to `~/bin`. `ops-inbox` runs
  it FIRST in every WhatsApp scan: it connection-probes the bridge with **curl** (not
  `ss | grep :8080`, which mis-resolves 8080 to the service name `webcache` and would bounce
  a healthy bridge), forces a backfill, triggers transcription, waits (bounded ~32s) for the
  store to settle, and prints a freshness report — only restarting the bridge if the curl
  probe genuinely fails twice. Exit 2 signals an unrecoverable bridge so callers never
  classify against a stale store.

### Changed

- `scripts/install-whatsapp-bridge-linux.sh` now also ships the voice-note transcriber and
  the freshness gate, drops + enables the `whatsapp-transcribe.{service,timer}` units (reading
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` from `~/.config/systemd/env/mcp-secrets.env`), and adds a
  `--no-transcribe-timer` opt-out.
- `skills/ops-inbox/SKILL.md` step-0 documents the freshness gate (run first) and that voice
  notes are first-class (`[voice] …` bodies), alongside the existing backfill + contacts-link
  auto-sync.
- **Full-thread-awareness gate (blocking, every channel, every session)** in
  `skills/ops-inbox/SKILL.md`. A new mandatory section forces, per thread before any
  NEEDS_REPLY or draft: read ≥25 messages in BOTH directions (incl. `is_from_me=1` rows and
  `[voice]` transcripts), reconcile outbound the store may miss (voice transcripts, the
  bridge `/api/send` log, the same contact's sends in other threads/channels), and write a
  2-sentence conversation-arc summary. `last_is_from_me` is now explicitly a first pass only;
  shallow both-direction reads bumped 20→25 / 5→25. Fixes the recurring fresh-session failure
  of re-flagging threads the user already answered (incl. phone-sent messages absent from the
  store) and drafting off shallow context. Depends on the freshness gate + voice transcription
  having run first so the store is complete.

> Folds in the bridge-side fixes already on `main` as of 2.18.x — outbound `/api/send`
> persistence, the `resync_app_state` endpoint, MCP dict serialisation (#404), and the
> WhatsApp autosync + LID contacts-link (#403) — and layers voice transcription + the
> freshness gate on top.

## 2.18.1 — 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Pre-promotion validation guard in `pocket-responder`.** When an _outbound_ action
  (`send_message` / `email_reply`) is approved, the responder now runs a staleness +
  standing-rule check **before** committing it to `tasks.jsonl`. It gathers recent
  thread/related activity (via `gog`, best-effort) and asks an LLM (`claude-haiku-4-5`)
  whether the action is still valid against the owner's rules. If it looks already
  handled, superseded, or rule-breaking (e.g. a meeting was already scheduled/accepted,
  or the draft commits to a time that should be delegated), it **HOLDS** instead of
  promoting — logging `approval-holds.jsonl` and replying with the reason + a
  `force <code>` override. Owner stays in control; the agent no longer fires
  obviously-stale approved actions.
  - Rules come from `POCKET_APPROVAL_RULES` / `~/.config/email-cos/approval-rules.md`
    (see `email-cos/approval-rules.example.md`), with a generic built-in fallback.
  - `force <code>` re-promotes a held action, bypassing the guard.
  - Degrades safely: disabled with `POCKET_VALIDATE_ACTIONS=0`; never blocks on its own
    error (missing LLM/`gog` → proceed); skips non-outbound and `social_publish` items.

## 2.18.0 — 2026-05-31

### Added

- **`pocket-responder`** — one canonical approval responder for the Pocket pipeline
  and social drafts. A single consumer of bot input and single writer of decisions:
  - **Button taps** (`✅ Approve` / `❌ Reject` / `a)`/`b)` choices),
  - **Freeform text** — a regex fast-path (`approve A1`, `A2 b`, `reject A3`) plus an
    optional LLM mapper (`claude-haiku-4-5`) for natural language (`"approve the
second one"`); low-confidence inputs ask to disambiguate rather than guess,
  - **`social_publish` ASKs** — on approve, publishes a staged draft via the
    Typefully skill (tap-to-publish), so a social drafter can stage a draft and the
    owner approves it from one chat surface.
  - `send` posts one tappable message per open ASK (idempotent, capped) and writes the
    A/D codemap so taps and text resolve to the same items; `process` drains a single
    normalized inbox (`responder-inbox.jsonl`). Self-contained — no dependency on
    `ops-pocket-approvals.py` internals.
  - New systemd user units `pocket-responder-send.{service,timer}` +
    `pocket-responder-process.{service,timer}`; wired into `email-cos/install.sh`
    (enabled when `EMAIL_COS_TG_ENABLE=true` + `EMAIL_COS_TG_CHAT_ID` set).

### Changed

- `scripts/ops-message-listener.sh` now tees owner-chat button taps **and** freeform
  text to `responder-inbox.jsonl` for the responder. Owner chat id comes from
  `RESPONDER_OWNER_CHAT_ID` / `EMAIL_COS_TG_CHAT_ID` / `TELEGRAM_OWNER_ID` (env/config,
  never hardcoded); the tee is a no-op when unset.
- `email-cos/install.sh` enables `pocket-responder-*` timers and retires the
  callback-only `email-cos-tg-process.timer` (folded into the responder).

## 2.17.0 — 2026-05-30

### Added

- **FLOW unification layer** (`/flow`) — one entrypoint over the three overlapping
  command systems (gstack dev-lifecycle, GSD `.planning/` phase machine, claude-ops
  `/ops:*`). Router/facade only — does NOT merge codebases; all three stay installed
  and self-updating, `/flow` delegates to the single canonical command per stage.
  - `skills/flow/SKILL.md` — the `/flow` router (keyword→canonical), mirrors the
    `/ops:ops` routing-table pattern.
  - `skills/flow/FLOW.md` — canonical lifecycle map (single source of truth):
    ideate→spec→plan→design→build→review→test→ship→deploy→monitor→retro, plus the
    **project-mode vs ad-hoc-mode** rule (repo `.planning/` state picks the
    abstraction level: GSD phase machine vs gstack stateless lifecycle).
  - `bin/flow-state` — "you are here" detector (mode + GSD phase + open PRs);
    GitHub-quota-safe (single non-watch `gh` call), `--json` for machines.
  - `docs/flow-guide.md` — user guide.

## 2.16.0 — 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Pocket decision-log module** (`scripts/ops-pocket-decisions.py`) — append-only,
  UTC-bucketed audit trail of triage ACT/ASK decisions, consumed by `ops-pocket-triage.py`
  via a portable `POCKET_SCRIPTS_DIR` loader (symlink-safe; no hardcoded `/opt` path).
- **Pocket webhook receiver** (`scripts/webhook-receiver/`) — `app.py` (signed-webhook
  ingest → handler handoff), `on-memory.sh` (journal + per-event dispatch), README.

### Security / Hardening (PR #369 review fixes)

- Webhook receiver claims dedup **after** successful handoff and **releases the claim +
  returns 500** on dispatch failure — prevents permanent loss of a recording on transient errors.
- Auth fails **closed** (503) when no signing secret is configured (was fail-open).
- Replay check accepts second- or millisecond-epoch timestamps (prevents total-ingestion 401 outage).
- `on-memory.sh` sanitizes the event name before any file path (post-auth path-traversal fix).
- `seen` dedup table + webhook journal pruned/rotated (bounded disk); decision-log load failure now logged, not swallowed.

## 2.14.0 — 2026-05-29

### Added

- **`/ops:ops-aws-audit`** — read-only, account-agnostic AWS audit skill. A single
  self-contained `scripts/ops-aws-audit.sh` that uses the caller's credential
  chain and **auto-discovers all enabled regions** for a full-account sweep.
  Severity-ranked findings (CRITICAL→LOW) in `report.md` + machine-readable
  `findings.json`, and a pixel-art terminal summary on completion. Covers IAM
  (root key/MFA, stale keys, Access Analyzer), EC2/EBS (unattached/gp2/unencrypted
  volumes, idle EIPs, world-open security groups incl. all-traffic), RDS
  (unencrypted/public, orphaned snapshots — Aurora-aware), S3 (account BPA,
  encryption, lifecycle), CloudWatch retention, Lambda EOL runtimes,
  GuardDuty/Security Hub/Cost Anomaly/Compute Optimizer enrollment, and
  per-service cost deltas. No mutations; cleanup stays human-gated.
- `scripts/install-aws-audit-cron.sh` — optional daily `systemd --user` timer.

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.18.6] - 2026-05-31

### Changed

fix(whatsapp-bridge): build with -tags sqlite_fts5 so the bridge's SQLite has the fts5 module — fixes silent message-storage failure where every INSERT hit the messages_fts triggers and failed with "no such module: fts5". ops-autofix now verifies binary fts5 capability before running the migration (PR #412).

## [2.18.5] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- `bin/ops-release` — reusable one-shot release tool: bumps plugin.json + marketplace.json (registry) + CHANGELOG in lockstep, opens a PR to main, optionally squash-merges and tags `vX.Y.Z`. See `RELEASE.md`.
- `RELEASE.md` — release process documentation.

### Changed

- ops-bg: `dispatch` now defaults the fleet/background agent working dir to `~/Projects` (override via `$OPSBG_DIR` or `--cwd`) and `cd`s into it before exec, so fleet agents start at the workspace root instead of an arbitrary repo (#410).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.15.0] — 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Triage decision-log hook** — `ops-pocket-triage.py` now records each triage decision (event type, confidence, reasoning) via `/opt/pocket-mcp/pipeline/ops-pocket-decisions.py` when present (try/except-guarded, no-op if absent), building an audit trail for downstream reporting.

### Changed

- **`ops-message-listener.sh` input hardening** — defense-in-depth on the dispatch path: env-var isolation for `QUEUE_FILE` (no shell interpolation), JSON load guarded by try/except + isinstance, per-message bounds (`MAX_LEN=4000`, sender ≤64), control-char stripping, and **NUL-delimited** dispatch output so newlines in message text can't smuggle extra dispatch lines. Merged on top of origin's existing stdin-piping fix; keeps the `|| true` call-site resilience.

_(Ports two patches that had been applied directly on the deploy box into the repo, so the live checkout can track main cleanly.)_

## [2.14.1] — 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- **`ops-pocket-notify` wrapper resolves symlinks.** The `bin/ops-pocket-notify` bash wrapper computed the Python script path from `dirname "$0"`, which resolves relative to a PATH symlink's directory rather than the real file — so invoking it via a `~/.local/bin` symlink failed to find `../scripts/ops-pocket-notify.py`. Now `readlink -f`s itself first. Also syncs `package.json` (had drifted to 2.13.0) to the plugin version.

## [2.13.0] — 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Config-driven pocket notifications (`ops-pocket-notify`) — interactive setup of which events, which channels, when.** Pocket components emit an _event id_; the new `bin/ops-pocket-notify` dispatcher decides routing from `preferences.json → pocket.notifications`: per-event channels (telegram/email/whatsapp/slack via the existing senders + out-queue), plus a **full per-event schedule** — cooldown, quiet-hours, active-days, and severity escalation (high bypasses windows). New events are **off by default**. `/ops:ops-settings → Configure notifications` walks each event interactively (channels + schedule + dry-run test-send) and writes the prefs; `docs/pocket-notifications.md` documents the schema + event taxonomy. The executor emits `worker.spawned` / `worker.failed`, and the env-broker's notify hook points at the dispatcher. `--dry-run --json` resolves routing without sending (used by setup + tests).

## [2.12.0] — 2026-05-29

### Added

- **pocket-env-broker — peer-authenticated secrets broker for restricted pocket workers.** Restricted background workers (which no longer inherit the orchestrator's secret env, per 2.11.9) can now request a _specific allowlisted_ secret at runtime via the `pocket-env <VAR>` client, instead of all-or-nothing. The broker (`scripts/pocket-env-broker.py`, runs as the privileged orchestrator user) listens on a unix socket, authenticates the caller with SO_PEERCRED (must be the worker uid), checks a **default-deny** allowlist (`env-broker-policy.json`), returns the value over the socket only (never to disk), and audits every grant/deny. Ships with the client, policy + systemd templates, docs, and tests; the pocket executor forwards the broker socket path + task/worker ids to workers.
- **Env-broker observability.** The broker keeps a metrics snapshot (`env-broker-health.json`: request/grant/deny/uid-rejection counters, recent denials, `anomaly` flag), exposes `pocket-env-broker --status [--json]`, and surfaces an `Env-broker` line in `/ops:ops-status` that raises a `⚠` anomaly on any uid rejection (a prompt-injection probing signal).
- **Env-broker push notifications (opt-in).** Set `POCKET_ENV_BROKER_NOTIFY_CMD` (+ `POCKET_ENV_BROKER_NOTIFY_COOLDOWN`, default 300s) and the broker fires that command with an alert on uid rejections / not-allowed denials — rate-limited, best-effort, never blocking request handling. Wired to the operator's own chat it is a self-notification (outbound-comms-gate exempt).

## [2.11.9] — 2026-05-29

### Security

- **Pocket executor: optional least-privilege worker isolation (`POCKET_WORKER_USER`).** `ops-cron-pocket-executor.py` can now launch each `claude --bg` worker as a restricted unix user via `sudo -n -H -u <user>` instead of inheriting the executor user's full privileges, capping the blast radius of a prompt-injected or auto-promoted task. Opt-in: set `POCKET_WORKER_USER` (and optionally `POCKET_WORKER_CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` to point the worker at a readable Claude config). Default unset = unchanged behaviour. `--dangerously-skip-permissions` is retained (required for unattended `--bg` workers) but is now bounded by the worker user's FS/network grants rather than running with the executor's full access.

## [2.11.8] — 2026-05-29

### Security

- **Account-rotation config: stop tracking `config.json`; readers prefer the gitignored override.** `rotate.mjs` and `kapture-claim-credits.mjs` now resolve the rotation config from `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR/account-rotation-config.json` (where `setup-account.mjs` already writes real accounts), falling back to a local gitignored `config.json` and then the shipped empty `config.example.json`. `config.json` is `git rm --cached`'d so real emails can never land in a tracked file (it was already in `.gitignore` but remained tracked). No data was ever leaked to the remote — the committed `config.json` was always the empty default; this closes the accidental-commit footgun.

## [2.11.7] — 2026-05-29

### Added

- **WhatsApp bridge: Linux (systemd-user) install path.** `scripts/install-whatsapp-bridge-linux.sh` clones lharries/whatsapp-mcp, applies the in-repo claude-ops patches (`scripts/whatsapp/apply-patches.py`), drops three systemd-user units (`whatsapp-bridge.service`, `whatsapp-backfill.service`, `whatsapp-backfill.timer`), and pairs via the bridge's pairing-code flow. Idempotent — re-running is safe and only applies missing patches.
- **`POST /api/backfill` REST endpoint** on the bridge (patch). Lets the claude-ops daemon, a 2h systemd timer, or `curl` trigger a fresh history backfill without restarting the bridge. Returns `{"success":true,"message":"backfill requested"}` when connected; 503 otherwise.
- **Auto-backfill on `events.Connected`** (patch). Every reconnect fires `requestHistorySync` 5s after Connected — replaces the previous "manual backfill only" behaviour. Idempotent; whatsmeow dedups by message ID.
- **Cross-platform `whatsapp-bridge` daemon entry** in `scripts/daemon-services.default.json` via `scripts/lib/whatsapp-bridge-up.sh` wrapper that branches `launchctl` (macOS) / `systemctl --user` (Linux). Replaces the previous launchctl-only `command`.
- **`whatsapp-backfill` daemon entry** (cron `0 */2 * * *`) — fallback trigger for hosts without the systemd timer.
- **Python MCP server (`whatsapp.py`) LID/contact resolver** (patch). `get_sender_name` now resolves via `whatsmeow_contacts.full_name/push_name/business_name` and `whatsmeow_lid_map` from the bridge's `whatsapp.db`, instead of relying on the macOS-only `contacts` table populated by Contacts.app. Group senders in `@lid` form now resolve to their real names on Linux.

### Fixed

- **`PairPhone` silent hang** in lharries/whatsapp-mcp (patch). Two fixes per the upstream whatsmeow godoc: (Fix A) `time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)` between `client.Connect()` and `client.PairPhone(...)` so the noise handshake completes; (Fix B) `context.WithTimeout(..., 3*time.Minute)` on `PairPhone` so an internal hang is recoverable instead of leaving the process zombied with no PairSuccess and no Timeout error.
- **`requestHistorySync` SIGSEGV** (patch). whatsmeow's `BuildHistorySyncRequest(nil, count)` panics because it dereferences `.Chat`/`.ID`/`.Timestamp` on the nil first arg (`send.go:572`). Rewritten to open `messages.db` read-only, pick the 50 most-recently-active chats, and anchor against each chat's oldest stored message — also more efficient than a global request.

### Changed

- **`/ops-inbox` multi-channel scan is now a parallel `Workflow` fan-out** — the scan/classify phase spawns one **read-only** scanner agent per _available_ channel concurrently (via the `Workflow` tool), each returning structured classified results (NEEDS_REPLY / WAITING / HANDLED / FYI + the `chatId` needed to reply), then a synthesizer merges them into prioritized buckets. Wall-clock collapses from sum-of-channels to slowest-single-channel. Rule 6 is preserved end-to-end: scanners are explicitly read-only (never send/archive/mutate) and **all** reply drafting, approval, and sending stay in the main session under the one-draft→one-approval→one-send gate; channels are availability-detected first so no scanner is spawned for an unconfigured channel. Agent Teams and sequential scan are retained as documented fallbacks for older harnesses under the same constraints.

## [2.11.6] — 2026-05-27

### Added

- **Telegram `claude/channel` MCP — inbound DMs push straight into the session (iMessage-grade)** — new `telegram-server/channel-mcp.mjs`: a stdio MCP server declaring `capabilities: { 'claude/channel': {} }` that long-polls the bot `getUpdates` and, for each new message from `TELEGRAM_OWNER_ID` (owner-allowlisted, prompt-injection-aware), emits `notifications/claude/channel` — injecting the DM into the active session as a turn, exactly like the iMessage channel. Replaces the fragile shell-poller relay: offset is persisted atomically to `~/.claude/channels/telegram/offset.json` (`offset = lastUpdateId + 1`, never freezes/replays). The old `ops-message-listener.sh` Telegram branch is gated behind `OPS_DISABLE_TG_POLLER` to avoid two-consumer getUpdates contention. Registered via `.mcp.json` `telegram-channel`.

## [2.11.5] — 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- **Rotation works headless on Linux (browser-auth)** — `rotate.mjs` gains Brave as a real-Chromium Tier-2 browser on aarch64 Linux (no ARM Chrome ships) in `REAL_BROWSERS` + the bootstrap scan; `gracefullyQuitApp` Linux `pkill -TERM` branch; the Tier-2 spawn uses a real `1280x800` viewport on Linux (the macOS `1x1` hide trick collapses claude.ai's responsive layout so the submit button is unclickable on Xvnc) + `--no-sandbox`; `pollGmailForMagicLink` reads each pool account's OWN inbox via `gog --account` (no Gmail-forwarding dependency); and the magic-link path fails the account cleanly on timeout instead of stalling on Google OAuth push-2FA. Preserves the 2.11.4 private-first selection + extra-usage exclusion.

## [2.11.4] — 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- **Rotation prefers PRIVATE accounts over TEAMS/org accounts** — `scripts/account-rotation/rotate.mjs` account selection now treats team-ness (accounts carrying `orgName`/`orgUuid`) as the PRIMARY sort key and utilization as secondary, so a personal Max account is always chosen over an org/Teams account when viable. Org accounts route through claude.ai's org chooser + Google Workspace push-2FA, which headless browser auth cannot clear — picking one on raw utilization (e.g. a low-util Teams account) caused rotation to stall on 2FA and fail. A team account is now only ever selected when no private account is viable.

### Added

- **`ops-telegram-bot-send`** — lightweight bot-token push to the operator's own Telegram chat, the companion to the user-account MCP server. Reads `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` + `TELEGRAM_OWNER_ID` from env or `preferences.json .channels.telegram.*` (zero hardcoded ids, Rule 0). Default recipient is the operator; `--to <chat_id>` overrides; `OPS_DRY_RUN=1` previews without sending.
  - For users who want notifications / bidirectional comms without the interactive gram.js phone+code login: provision a @BotFather token, `/start` the bot, grab the numeric chat id from @userinfobot, set the two values, done.
  - `docs/telegram-bot-send.md` documents setup and the **self-channel exception** for `block-outbound-comms.py` — sends to the operator's own chat are operational self-notifications and skip the approval token (mirroring the existing email / WhatsApp / iMessage self-channel exceptions), while third-party Telegram sends stay gated under Rule 6.

## [2.11.3] — 2026-05-25

### Added

- **`ops-bg send <id> "<msg>"`** (#349) — inject a user message into a running `claude --bg` session without attaching its TUI. Useful when a backgrounded session is blocked on an `AskUserQuestion` and you already know the answer, when an orchestrator wants to nudge / ack / close a shipped session from automation, or as a non-UI escape hatch when the dashboard's "awaiting input" panel breaks.
  - `claude-ops/scripts/bg-send.py` — talks to the supervisor's UNIX control socket at `/tmp/cc-daemon-<uid>/<sha8>/control.sock` (instance dir discovered from `~/.claude/daemon/roster.json`) and issues a newline-delimited JSON `{"proto":1,"op":"reply","short":"<8 hex chars>","text":"..."}\n` message. Protocol reverse-engineered from claude `2.1.150`.
  - `claude-ops/bin/ops-bg send` — thin shell wrapper that shells out to the helper. Aliases: `reply`, `msg`.

- **`/ops:desktop` skill + `desktop-act` MCP wiring** — autonomous desktop + browser control surfaced as a first-class ops command. Acquires a noVNC desktop session, takes screenshots, clicks, types, scrolls, and runs the autonomous `act()` loop driven by the bundled `claude-agent-sdk` (OAuth via Claude Max, no Anthropic API key). Cross-platform launcher (Linux full / macOS / Windows partial).
- **`mcp-servers/desktop-act-launcher.py`** — pure-Python cross-platform launcher. Resolves an installed `desktop-act` companion in (1) `$DESKTOP_ACT_COMMAND`, (2) `$DESKTOP_ACT_HOME`, (3) `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/plugins/marketplaces/desktop-act`, (4) the per-OS Claude config dir, (5) the per-user cache (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME` on Linux, `~/Library/Caches` on macOS, `%LOCALAPPDATA%` on Windows). If none exist it `git clone`s `$DESKTOP_ACT_REPO` (default your-org/desktop-act), bootstraps a venv, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then `execv`s the runner. Falls back to a clear error message — never hangs the MCP host.
- **plugin.json userConfig keys** — `desktop_act_command`, `desktop_act_home`, `desktop_act_repo`, `desktop_act_branch` for per-user overrides.
- **`.mcp.json` `desktop-act` server registration** — wired via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/mcp-servers/desktop-act-launcher.py`. All `mcp__desktop-act__*` tools (`acquire_desktop`, `screenshot`, `click`, `type_text`, `act`, …) are now part of the ops surface.
- **AWS Security Group IP-whitelist auto-updater** — keeps a single SG ingress rule synced to your current public IPv4 across Wi-Fi switches, VPN flaps, and ISP IP rotations. Useful for dev sandboxes / bastion hosts that should only accept connections from your laptop.
  - `scripts/aws-sg-ip-whitelist.sh` — idempotent core: detect public IP → reap stale managed rules → authorize new IP with a timestamped description. Configured via `IP_WHITELIST_SG_ID` / `IP_WHITELIST_REGION` / `IP_WHITELIST_PORT` / `IP_WHITELIST_DESC_PREFIX` / `IP_WHITELIST_KEEP_RECENT` env vars.
  - `scripts/ssh-auto-whitelist.sh` — SSH wrapper that retries once after refreshing the SG when the first attempt times out / is refused.
  - `scripts/install-ip-whitelist-agent.sh` + `launchd/com.claude-ops.ip-whitelist.plist.template` — macOS launchd agent that fires on `/etc/resolv.conf` changes (network state) with a 5-minute fallback poll and a 30-second throttle. Linux support stubbed (cron / systemd path-unit guidance in the installer output).
  - `plugin.json` userConfig: `ip_whitelist_sg_id`, `ip_whitelist_region`, `ip_whitelist_port`, `ip_whitelist_desc_prefix`, `ip_whitelist_keep_recent`.

### Notes

- Linux is the primary supported platform for desktop-act (X11 + Xvnc + websockify + python-xlib). macOS and Windows can launch the server but native X11 calls no-op; browser/Kapture paths still work.
- First run on a fresh box performs a one-time clone + `pip install`. Subsequent launches `execv` directly into the cached venv with no extra latency.

## [2.11.2] — 2026-05-23

### Added

- **feat(ops): integrate Claude Code background-server supervisor** (#338) — first-class visibility + dispatch ergonomics for `claude --bg` background sessions across the ops plugin. Claude Code ships a persistent supervisor that hosts `--bg` agents independently of the interactive session (survives terminal close, sleep, CC binary upgrades).
  - `bin/ops-doctor` — new section 10c probes `claude agents --json` (fallback: `claude daemon status`). Adds `claude_background_server` to JSON output with `supervisor_status` (`running|idle|unreachable`), `bg_sessions`, `interactive_sessions`. Warns when roster claims live sessions but control socket is dead (→ `claude respawn --all`).
  - `bin/ops-status` — new `Claude bg` row in pretty panel + `claude_bg` field in `--json`. Distinguishes healthy ephemeral idle from broken-supervisor unreachable. Drive-by fix: bash 5.3 parses `${!ARR[*]:-}` as indirect-on-values, causing "invalid variable name" on Voice/Monitoring rows; guarded with array-bound + length check.
  - `bin/ops-bg` (new) — thin wrapper around `claude --bg | agents --json | attach | logs | stop | rm | respawn` with standardized defaults (`--model opus --effort high --add-dir $PWD`). Subcommands: `dispatch | list | status | attach | logs | stop | rm | respawn`.
- **feat(autopilot): auto-downshift Meta + Google Ads budgets when over cap** (#337) — autopilot detects when ad spend crosses the configured daily cap and automatically reduces the active budget on both Meta Marketing API and Google Ads API, preventing runaway spend without manual intervention.

## [2.11.0] — 2026-05-22

First-class Linux parity for the background daemon, plus two cross-platform fixes that surfaced during Linux bring-up on Amazon Linux 2023.

### Added

- **`scripts/install-ops-daemon-linux.sh`** — idempotent Linux installer that mirrors `install-ops-daemon.sh` (macOS launchd). Provisions a `systemd --user` service, enables `loginctl` linger, fixes the cache-permission footgun (chowns `~/.claude/plugins/cache/` back to the invoking user when a prior `sudo` left it root-owned), validates `bash >= 4`, and supports `--dry-run` and `--uninstall`. WSL2 with `systemd=true` in `/etc/wsl.conf` uses the same path; WSL without systemd still gets the legacy `nohup` fallback.
- **`scripts/systemd/claude-ops-daemon.service`** — unit template using `%h` for HOME, `Type=simple`, `Restart=on-failure (10s)`, `WantedBy=default.target`, env block that explicitly sets `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` so the daemon and every child service it spawns resolve scripts even outside the user's interactive shell.

### Changed

- **`skills/setup/SKILL.md` Step 2c** — Linux branch no longer prints "out of scope / skipped"; it invokes `install-ops-daemon-linux.sh` and writes `daemon.platform = "linux-systemd"` to `$PREFS_PATH`. macOS launchd path unchanged.
- **`scripts/systemd/install-systemd-units.sh` + 6 pocket unit templates** — replaced hard-coded `__HOME__/claude-ops/claude-ops/scripts/` with `__PLUGIN_ROOT__`, resolved at install time to the canonical install path. Eliminates the silent-failure mode where a missing `~/claude-ops` symlink froze all 4 pocket health files.

### Fixed

- **`bin/ops-doctor` GNU `stat` crash** — `_pocket_health_check` used `stat -f '%m' || stat -c '%Y'`. On GNU coreutils `-f` means _filesystem stat_ (not BSD's _format string_), so the first invocation succeeds with multi-line FS info and the fallback never fires. `MTIME` then becomes a multi-line blob and `$(( NOW - MTIME ))` parses words like `File:` as variable names under `set -u`. Flipped to try `-c '%Y'` first and defensively trim `MTIME` to its first numeric token.
- **`bin/ops-doctor` false-positive flood for `unconfigured_sensitive_keys`** — used to warn about every one of the ~29 `sensitive: true` user-config keys declared in `plugin.json` (Datadog, NewRelic, Pushover, ntfy, Discord bot, 7 shipping carriers, etc.), even when no MCP server or skill referenced them. Now: collects env-var names from every `.mcp.json` and `~/.claude.json` mcpServers env block, filters `SENSITIVE_KEYS` to only those actually used, and skips the rest silently.

### Verified on

- Amazon Linux 2023 (aarch64, kernel 6.1, systemd 252) — install, re-run idempotency, `--dry-run`, `--uninstall`, ops-doctor recovery, pocket health refresh, `tests/test-no-secrets.sh` (14/14 pass).
- macOS launchd path unchanged (no regression touched).
- WSL2 / Ubuntu / Fedora desktop — not yet exercised; please flag regressions.

## [2.9.1] — 2026-05-21

Rule 7 compliance for `bin/ops-voice` **plus** a new `join` sub-command that auto-joins the current or next calendar meeting with smart AV defaults. Native open-paths now route through `lib/opener.sh::ops_open_url` so SSH/mobile sessions get a copy-able URL block instead of opening on the remote host.

### Added

- **`bin/ops-voice join [--at now|next|HH:MM] [--window MIN] [--dry-run]`** — reads `gog calendar events --all --today -j`, picks the current event (within ±10min) or the next future event, extracts the conference URL (Google Meet via `hangoutLink`, Zoom/Meet/Teams/Webex via `conferenceData.entryPoints[]`, then location/description URL scan), classifies the meeting kind, applies a smart AV policy, and hands off to the native opener.
- **Smart AV policy** — 1–2 attendees → cam ON + mic ON; 3–9 → cam ON + mic MUTED; 10+ → cam OFF + mic MUTED. Per-event overrides via `[cam:on|off]` / `[mic:on|off|muted]` tags in the event description.
- **Lid-state mic selection** — macOS via `ioreg AppleClamshellState` (Yes=closed → external mic, No=open → MacBook mic); Linux via `/proc/acpi/button/lid/*/state`; other OSes report `unknown` → "default" mic source.
- **Elgato Camera Hub auto-launch** — when installed, opens Camera Hub before the meeting starts so the Elgato virtual cam registers. Detects: macOS `.app` under `/Applications` or `~/Applications`, Linux `elgato-camera-hub` on PATH or AppImage in `~/Applications`, Windows/WSL `${PROGRAMFILES}\Elgato\CameraHub\CameraHub.exe`.
- **Zoom `https://zoom.us/j/<ID>?pwd=<PWD>` → `zoommtg://` URL rewriting** — extracted Zoom links convert to the desktop-app URL scheme, skipping the browser prompt. Honors `cam=off` by appending `&zc=0`.

### Changed

- **`lib/opener.sh`** — `ops_open_url` scheme allow-list extended to include `facetime:`, `facetime-audio:`, and `zoommtg:` (was: `https?://`, `mailto:`, `tel:` only). All other schemes still rejected.
- **`bin/ops-voice`** — sources `lib/opener.sh` and adds an `open_native` helper that prefers `ops_open_url` and falls back to `/usr/bin/open` when the lib is missing. `cmd_phone`, `cmd_facetime`, `zoom start`, and `zoom join` all swapped over.
- **`iso8601_to_epoch` cross-OS helper** — replaces jq's `fromdateiso8601` (which only accepts `Z`, not `+HH:MM` offsets). Tries GNU `date -d` first, falls back to BSD `date -j -f` with colon-strip, then jq's UTC-only parse as last resort. Works on macOS, Linux, WSL, and FreeBSD.

### Smoke test

```
$ bin/ops-voice join --dry-run
dry-run: would join "Weekly Sync" (meet, 3 attendees)
  url=https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij
  cam=on mic=muted
  lid=closed mic_source=external
  elgato_hub=/Applications/Elgato Camera Hub.app
```

```
$ OPS_PRINT_URLS=1 bin/ops-voice phone "+1234567890"
  Open this URL on your device:

  tel:+1234567890
```

## [2.9.0] — 2026-05-21

`/ops:ops-voice` rebuilt as a full voice/phone/video surface. Native macOS Phone.app (Continuity), FaceTime audio/video, and Zoom now work with zero credentials; Twilio voice + SMS and Bland AI agent calls added for programmatic outbound. New `bin/ops-voice` shell wrapper mirrors the `bin/ops-discord` pattern.

### Added

- **`bin/ops-voice`** — single entry point with sub-commands `phone`, `facetime`, `zoom {start|join|schedule}`, `twilio-call`, `twilio-sms`, `bland-call`. JSON output mode via `--json`. Credential resolution: env → `ops_cred_get` (keychain) → `preferences.json` → Doppler.
- **Native macOS handlers** — `tel:`, `facetime:`, `facetime-audio:`, and `zoommtg:` URL schemes invoked via `/usr/bin/open`. No API keys required.
- **Twilio voice + SMS** — `twilio-call <to> <from> --twiml <URL>` and `twilio-sms <to> <from> "<body>"` via `api.twilio.com/2010-04-01`. Per-message approval (Rule 6) enforced.
- **Bland AI agent calls** — `bland-call <number> "<task prompt>"` posts to `api.bland.ai/v1/calls` with recording enabled. Returns call_id + poll URL.
- **Zoom REST scheduling** — `zoom schedule "<topic>" --start <ISO8601> --duration <min>` via `api.zoom.us/v2/users/me/meetings`. Requires `ZOOM_API_TOKEN` (Server-to-Server OAuth access token).
- **Routing in `/ops:comms`** — `call <contact>`, `facetime <contact>`, `start a zoom`, `join zoom <id>`, `text <contact> "<body>"`, and `have an AI call <contact>` now resolve to `bin/ops-voice` sub-commands with contact-number lookup via `mcp__whatsapp__search_contacts` and `preferences.json` → `contacts`.
- **Channel picker** — `voice` added to the empty-args picker batch when `channels.voice` is configured or `default_channels` includes `"voice"`.

### Changed

- **`skills/ops-voice/SKILL.md`** — rewritten from "call (Bland only) / tts / transcribe / setup" to the full 8-subcommand surface above. Existing `tts` (ElevenLabs) and `transcribe` (Groq Whisper) preserved. Rule 6 outbound-comms guardrail and Rule 7 mobile-mode notes added inline.

### Known follow-up

- `bin/ops-voice` calls `/usr/bin/open` directly for native channels — needs Rule 7 adapter via `lib/opener.sh::ops_open_url` so SSH/mobile sessions get a copy-able URL instead of opening on the remote host. Tracked as v2.9.1 patch.
- Twilio inbound webhook routing (SMS-in → ops daemon) deferred to v2.10.

## [2.8.3] — 2026-05-21

`/ops:ops-dash` data completeness pass — every section now reflects the full portfolio across all integrations (PRs #284–#290).

### Added

- **Multi-brand competitor intel** (#285) — competitor probe sources `scripts/lib/competitor/context.sh` and iterates `.brands[]`. One line per brand with 7d high-alert count, last-run date, top alert snippet (truncated 140 chars).
- **All-project marketing dashboard** (#284) — renders one row per configured project (9 projects), sorted worst-health-first. Each row: project, health score, blended ROAS, top channel. Mobile collapses to single summary line.
- **Linear multi-workspace + all-teams scan** (#287) — iterates `LINEAR_API_KEY`, `MY-PROJECT_LINEAR_API_KEY`, `EXAMPLE-PROJECT_LINEAR_API_KEY`. Enumerates all teams per workspace, de-dupes across keys, prefixes urgent rows with team key (`[TEAM] TEAM-4246`).
- **Calendar all-calendar aggregation** (#286, #290) — `gog calendar events --all --today --sort start -j` surfaces events across every calendar. New `render_section_calendar` always renders — events list, "0 events today", or "not configured" + hint.
- **Standalone FinOps block** (#290) — split from Revenue & Costs into its own `🔥 FINOPS` section: burn 7d / burn 30d / runway / services tracked / top 3 anomalies. Pulls `/api/ops/anomalies`.
- **Portfolio includes Shopify-only projects** (#288) — extracts `.ecom.projects` from preferences, renders `── shopify ──` subsection. Each row: project, kind, masked store URL, status (🟢/🟡/⚪). Header: `41 projects total — 38 git + 3 shopify, 14 GSD active`.

### Fixed

- **FinOps endpoint mismatch** (#289) — `bin/ops-dash` was calling `/api/summary` (session-auth only). Switched to `/api/ops/snapshot` with proper field mapping and `preferences.finops` as cred fallback. Also fixed `FINOPS_OPS_API_TOKEN` missing from Render env.
- **FinOps net summation** (#290) — snapshot ingest was summing `{gross, credit_applied, net}` as if per-service map. Now reads `.net` with `.gross` fallback.

## [2.8.2] — 2026-05-21

`/ops:ops-dash` rewritten as a 2026-aesthetic hybrid live command center — pixel-art hero + 12 section-by-section panels ingesting live data from every `/ops:*` skill (PR #282).

### Fixed

- **Unread counts always 0** — `bin/ops-dash` was reading `.whatsapp.count` / `.email.count` / `.slack.count` from `ops-unread`, but the actual schema is `.channels.whatsapp.recent_chats` / `.channels.email.inbox_count` / `.channels.slack.workspaces[]`. Smoke test: 90 unread now detected (was 0).
- **PR count always `?`** — `gh pr list --state open` with no `--repo` flag returns nothing when run outside a repo cwd (the bin script runs from `$HOME`). Replaced with `gh api graphql` cross-org search. Smoke test: 17 PRs now detected (was `?`).
- **Marketing project name rendered outside its parens** — cosmetic alignment fix.

### Changed

- **`bin/ops-dash` — hybrid live command center.** 12 section panels render top-to-bottom after the hero header: FIRES, INBOX, OPEN PRs, PORTFOLIO, REVENUE, MARKETING, LINEAR, DEPLOYS, COMPETITOR, YOLO, QUICK ACTIONS, footer. All probes fire in parallel via background subshells; render is sequential top-to-bottom once `wait` completes.
- **2026 visual layer** — pixel-art hero with double-line borders + drop shadow, animated braille spinner + progress bar during probe-wait, emoji icons on every section header and data row (🔥📬🔀🗂️💰📣📊🚀🕵️🤖⚡ / 💬📧💼✈️📓 / ✅⚠️🚨⏳🟢🔴🟡), unicode sparklines on time-series data (`▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█`), truecolor cyan-violet gradient palette (`38;2;R;G;B` when `$COLORTERM=truecolor`, else 256-color fallback), at-a-glance vitals strip, randomized footer one-liner.
- **Mobile/SSH graceful degradation** — detected via `$SSH_CONNECTION$SSH_CLIENT$SSH_TTY` or `$OPS_MOBILE=1`; falls back to plain-text section list, no ANSI boxes, no animations. `NO_COLOR=1` and `TERM=dumb` also honored.

### Known follow-up

- Portfolio section shows `(no git)` for registry paths stored with literal `~/` prefix (e.g. `~/my-project-api`) because `git -C` doesn't expand tildes. Cosmetic — does not affect rolled-up stats. To be fixed by tilde-expanding paths at read time.

## [2.8.1] — 2026-05-21

Hotfix: three production bugs in `/ops:ops-inbox` (PR #280).

### Fixed

- **WhatsApp bridge restart** — bare `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$UID/<label>` fails with `Could not find service` when the LaunchAgent isn't loaded (common after reboot or partial plist edit). Replaced with load-then-kickstart recipe (quoted target + `launchctl load -w "$PLIST"` fallback + `lsof -i :8080` verify). Health check now uses `launchctl print "gui/$(id -u)/<label>"` instead of `launchctl list` (which only shows already-loaded services).
- **`gog gmail thread get -j` parsing** — agents kept writing naive `d['messages']` or `d['payload']` parsers expecting the search-array shape, then crashing with `KeyError` on the actual `{thread: {messages: [{payload: {headers}}]}}` envelope. Added an explicit shape table for the three read commands and a canonical copy-paste-safe `classify_thread()` Python recipe with graceful empty/error handling. Documented the fast-path: triage from the search envelope's `labels` + `from` fields without per-thread fetches.
- **Stale plugin-version pin** — when `installed_plugins.json` (source of truth for `ops-plugin-version-heal.sh`) references a cache dir that no longer exists on disk, the heal hook becomes a no-op and downstream files keep their stale path, producing a recurring `Stop hook error: Plugin directory does not exist: …` on every turn. Added a runtime self-heal step at the top of the Runtime Context section that detects the mismatch, patches the source pin to the latest version present in the cache dir, then re-runs the existing heal script.

## [2.7.0] — 2026-05-20

`/ops:marketing` becomes the marketing control center. Every credential discoverable across Doppler/env/keychain auto-links into every project; live KPI rollup across all projects in one render; ad spend aggregated across every paid surface; Stripe revenue with UTM-attributed ROAS; Sentry crash-rate correlation flags ad-spend-at-risk projects.

Builds on v2.6.0 (`/ops:marketing <project>` point-and-go).

### Added

- **`marketing-auth-prewarm` daemon** (`scripts/ops-marketing-auth-prewarm.sh`) — nightly at 04:23 UTC, scans every Doppler project + env vars + shell profiles + macOS keychain + `~/.gcp/*.json` for marketing credentials. Classifies into 20 categories (ads_meta, ads_google, ads_tiktok, ads_linkedin, analytics_ga4, analytics_amplitude, analytics_posthog, email_resend, email_klaviyo, payments_stripe, ecommerce_shopify, fulfillment_shipbob, sms_twilio, errors_sentry, issues_linear, mta_appsflyer, prospect_apollo, infra_cloudflare, infra_vercel). Writes cache at `$OPS_DATA_DIR/marketing-auth-prewarm.json`. Initial scan across 47 Doppler projects found 19 active categories.

- **`bin/ops-marketing-link-prewarm`** — reads the prewarm cache and idempotently writes Doppler cred-refs into `marketing.projects.<key>.<category>.*` slots that are not yet configured. Modes: `--project <key>`, `--all-projects`, `--project <key> --category <cat>`. Atomic prefs writes; never overwrites existing values. Eliminates per-credential prompts during `/ops:marketing setup`.

- **`bin/ops-marketing-portfolio` extension** — new flags `--live`, `--kpis`, `--prewarm-status`. `--live` fans out in parallel to every signal source (Meta + Google Ads spend, Stripe revenue + MRR + UTM-attributed ROAS, GA4 sessions/conversions/CVR, Sentry crash-free-rate) and renders a unified KPI table. Mobile-aware per CLAUDE.md Rule 7. `--prewarm-status` surfaces untapped credentials (creds exist in Doppler but not linked to any project).

- **`scripts/lib/ad-spend-aggregator.sh`** — `ad_spend_meta`, `ad_spend_google`, `ad_spend_tiktok`, `ad_spend_linkedin`, `ad_spend_reddit`, `ad_spend_microsoft`, `ad_spend_pinterest`, `ad_spend_all`. Each normalizes to `{surface, project, spend, impressions, clicks, conversions, conversions_value, roas, window_days}`.

- **`scripts/lib/stripe-revenue.sh`** — `stripe_revenue_7d <project>` returns `{revenue_7d, charge_count, refund_count, active_mrr, active_sub_count, by_utm_source[]}`. UTM-attributed breakdown closes the ground-truth ROAS gap.

- **`scripts/lib/sentry-crash.sh`** — `sentry_crash_rate <project>` returns `{crash_free_7d, crash_free_24h, delta_dod, at_risk}`. When `at_risk == true` AND project has live ad spend, `portfolio --live` shows the project as "ad spend likely wasted today".

- **`scripts/lib/marketing-kpis.sh`** — pure functions: `kpi_roas`, `kpi_cac`, `kpi_ltv`, `kpi_payback_months`, `kpi_cvr`, `kpi_ctr`, `kpi_health_score`, `kpi_compute_all`. Derives metrics from already-fetched JSON — no external API calls.

- **`ops-marketing-provision provision-instagram` + `provision-google-ads`** verbs (from PR #266) — Meta token + page_id → IG Business Account ID auto-resolution with appsecret_proof signing; full 4-step Google Ads OAuth flow.

### Fixed

- `bin/ops-marketing-dash` — Meta + IG Graph API calls now compute and append `appsecret_proof` when `meta.app_secret` is configured. Previously the dash silently returned zeros for any project using a system-user token with "Require App Secret" enabled.

### Tests

107 tests passing across 6 test files: `test-ad-spend-aggregator.sh` (18), `test-stripe-revenue.sh` (6), `test-sentry-crash.sh` (2), `test-marketing-kpis.sh` (36), `test-ops-marketing-link-prewarm.sh` (15), `test-ops-marketing-auth-prewarm.sh` (1), plus all existing `test-ops-marketing-provision.sh` (11). Zero secrets leaked (`test-no-secrets.sh` 14/14 green).

## [2.6.0] — 2026-05-19

`/ops:marketing <project>` — point-and-go autonomous marketing agent (self-provisioning + self-healing + closed ROAS loop).

Seven PRs (#258, #260, #261, #256, #257, #262, #263) complete the arc from v2.4/v2.5's spend-bounded autopilot into a fully self-sufficient agent: it provisions its own analytics and DNS, fires its own conversion events, reads real revenue to close the ROAS loop, generates organic content as a parallel growth lane, and self-heals credential failures — all without manual intervention after the initial `/ops:marketing <project>` invocation.

### Added

- **Single-entry-point `/ops:marketing <project>`** — one command provisions, enables autopilot, and starts the loop for a new project (#258). New verbs `autopilot enable|disable|run|kill <project>` added alongside the existing `autopilot` subcommand surface. New `bin/ops-daemon-manager` shim closes a silent-fallback gap in the daemon setup flow (previously, a missing launchd plist silently fell through without error).

- **Self-provisioning across 4 surfaces** (#256, #260, #257):
  - `bin/ops-marketing-provision` — end-to-end GA4 property creation + Google Search Console site registration, full OAuth bootstrap, Doppler secret push, idempotent GET-before-create pattern throughout. Shared resolver extracted to `scripts/lib/ga4-resolve.sh` so both `ops-marketing-provision` and `ops-marketing-dash` share one GA4 lookup path (#256).
  - `bin/ops-dns-provision` — Cloudflare-API-driven DNS provisioner covering GSC TXT ownership verification, Meta AEM domain verification, SPF/DKIM/DMARC email-auth records, MX, Apple Pay domain association, and Klaviyo dedicated-sending setup. 8 named subcommands plus `audit` (diff current vs desired) and `provision-all` (idempotent full-stack). Backed by new reusable lib `scripts/lib/cloudflare-dns.sh` which any other ops bin can source for idempotent CF DNS operations (#260).
  - `bin/ops-conversion-send` (GA4 Measurement Protocol v2 event sender) + `bin/ops-meta-capi-send` (Meta Conversions API sender with SHA-256 PII hashing) + `scripts/ops-stripe-conversion-bridge.mjs` (Node.js Stripe webhook handler that fans out to GA4 MP + Meta CAPI in parallel) — closes the "we provisioned conversion secrets but never fire them" gap (#257). UTM enforcement library `scripts/lib/utm-validate.sh` + canonical attribution standard documented at `data/gtm/utm-attribution-standard.md`.

- **Closed ROAS loop (#262):** autopilot now reads real performance data on every pass — GA4 conversion events (Measurement Protocol), GSC search-analytics (clicks/impressions/CTR/position), Klaviyo flow revenue, and Stripe ground-truth revenue. Bandit reward path upgraded from Meta-CPL-only to **blended** (GA4 + Meta) when available, or **Stripe ground-truth** when `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is configured. New **ROAS-rescue gate**: campaigns where `stripe_revenue >= OPS_PAUSE_ROAS_FLOOR × meta_spend` are excluded from the Meta-CPL pause sweep — preventing the autopilot from pausing profitable campaigns that happen to have high CPL. UTM enforcement wired into campaign-creation paths so all new campaigns produce attributable data from day one. Shared GA4 Data API helper extracted to `scripts/lib/ga4-data-api.sh`.

- **Organic content generation (#261):** four new bins — `bin/ops-content-landing` (landing page variant generation), `bin/ops-content-seo` (SEO blog post drafting), `bin/ops-content-email` (Klaviyo email flow copy), `bin/ops-content-social` (LinkedIn/X/Instagram social calendar). Corresponding cron daemons: `content-seo` (GSC opportunity loop — surfaces high-impression/low-CTR queries, drafts posts targeting them), `content-email` (Klaviyo flow draft cadence), `content-social` (rolling 7-day social calendar). **Draft-only discipline throughout** — no bin auto-publishes, no bin auto-sends; all output is staged files + human-action recommendations, fully compliant with Rule 6. Generation is refused when `marketing.projects.<key>.brand.voice` is absent, escalating with an onboarding prompt — no wellness-defaults or placeholder voice will leak into generated copy.

- **Self-healing autopilot (#263):**
  - **Meta token auto-refresh:** error 190 (access token expired) triggers automatic long-lived token exchange via Graph OAuth `fb_exchange_token` endpoint; new token written back to Doppler immediately. Requires `marketing.projects.<key>.meta.app_id` + `meta.app_secret` in config (gracefully escalates if absent rather than silently skipping).
  - **Google Ads OAuth recovery:** refresh failures promoted from silent skip to `escalate()` with distinction between `invalid_grant` (requires re-auth, 48h outage threshold before escalating) and transient network errors (retry with backoff).
  - **Strict credential resolver:** new `resolve_cred_strict()` distinguishes "credential not configured" (rc=1, normal skip) from "Doppler key declared but value empty" (rc=2, escalate — a provisioning gap that should never silently pass).
  - **Multi-sink notify fan-out:** `notify()` now iterates the `marketing.notify.sinks` array and delivers to all configured sinks (telegram, slack, email, whatsapp) in parallel. Per-project legacy `notify_sink` string still works as single-sink fallback.
  - **`--health-check` subcommand** — probes Meta token TTL, Google Ads OAuth validity, ad-account status, Doppler secret freshness, GA4 service-account key, and GSC site auth. Exits non-zero and prints a remediation checklist on any failure. New `marketing-health-check` daemon (Sunday 08:00 UTC, disabled by default) runs this check weekly and routes failures to the notify fan-out.

### Changed

- **Rule 0 cleanup (#258):** 9 files scrubbed of real domains, emails, and repo slugs that had leaked into committed code: `bin/ops-meta-workspace-bootstrap`, `bin/ops-deploy-fix-build-trigger`, `prompts/build-fix.md`, `prompts/deploy-fix.md`, `skills/ops-secret-sync/SKILL.md`, `scripts/account-rotation/bulk-setup-token.mjs`, `scripts/lib/competitor/context.sh`, `scripts/lib/creative/context.sh`, `scripts/lib/creative/generate.sh`, `scripts/ops-gsd-registry-sync.sh`, `skills/setup/SKILL.md`. All replaced with `<placeholder>` / `$ENV_VAR` / `your-org/your-repo` forms.
- **Hardcoded brand-voice defaults removed (#258):** wellness-vocabulary defaults stripped from `bin/ops-marketing-autopilot` and `scripts/lib/creative/generate.sh`. Autopilot now refuses content generation when `brand.voice` is absent and escalates with an onboarding prompt rather than silently substituting a default voice. This prevents content intended for one brand's audience from being generated with another brand's vocabulary.
- **Per-project install marker (#258):** `${STATE_DIR}/${proj}.installed` replaces a prior global marker so each newly-added project gets its own forced dry-run on first pass, regardless of whether other projects are already installed.
- **Mutation-counter leak fix (#258):** `MUTATIONS`, `ESCALATED`, and `CREATED_CAMPAIGNS` counters now reset at the top of each project iteration, preventing counts from accumulating across projects in a single autopilot run.
- **`scripts/lib/cloudflare-dns.sh`** (#260) is a general-purpose reusable lib — any other ops bin can `source` it for idempotent Cloudflare DNS record management without duplicating CF API boilerplate.
- **`scripts/lib/ga4-data-api.sh`** (#262) extracted from `ops-marketing-dash` so both the dashboard and the autopilot share one GA4 Data API helper with consistent error handling.
- **`scripts/ops-stripe-conversion-bridge.mjs`** (#257) lives at `scripts/` as a `.mjs` Node.js module rather than `bin/` (which is bash-only by convention). Invoke via `node scripts/ops-stripe-conversion-bridge.mjs` or the provided systemd/launchd example in the file header.

### Breaking Changes

- **`META_<BRAND>_*` Doppler key pattern** — previously, per-brand Meta credentials used a hardcoded prefix. Operators with existing configurations must migrate their Doppler keys to the `META_${PROJECT^^}_*` pattern (e.g., `META_MYPROJECT_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `META_MYPROJECT_AD_ACCOUNT_ID`). The autopilot will emit a `resolve_cred_strict rc=2` escalation (not a silent skip) for any project where the old key pattern is detected, making the migration gap visible rather than silently passing with no data.
- **`OPS_DEPLOY_FIX_REPO_SLUG` + `OPS_DEPLOY_FIX_REPO_ORG`** — these env vars are now required for the build-trigger hook; previously they were hardcoded. Existing deployments must add both vars to their environment or Doppler project before the next deploy-fix invocation.
- **`marketing.projects.<key>.meta.app_id` + `meta.app_secret`** — required for Meta auto-refresh (error 190 recovery). If absent, the autopilot does not fail — it escalates with a remediation prompt — but token refresh will not be attempted and an expired token will block the Meta channel until manually rotated.

### Migration Guide

1. **Existing autopilot users** — no action required for existing projects. All new features are additive and opt-in. The autopilot's spend-safety guarantees, `create_once` default, and `--dry-run` behavior are unchanged.

2. **New project setup** — `/ops:marketing <project>` is the one-shot entry point. It runs `provision-all` (GA4 + GSC + DNS), then `autopilot enable`, then starts the daemon. For projects with existing GA4/GSC already provisioned, the GET-first idempotency pattern means re-running provision is safe.

3. **Conversion senders** — after provisioning, fire one debug event per channel to verify the full pipeline before live traffic: `bin/ops-conversion-send --debug` (GA4 MP — check Realtime in GA4 UI), `bin/ops-meta-capi-send --test-event-code <code>` (Meta — check Events Manager test events tab). Stripe bridge: deploy with `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` set and send a `payment_intent.succeeded` test event from the Stripe dashboard.

4. **Multi-sink notify** — populate `marketing.notify.sinks` array in `preferences.json` with any combination of `["telegram", "slack", "email", "whatsapp"]`. Legacy per-project `notify_sink: "telegram"` string still works as a single-sink fallback and does not need migration.

## [2.5.0] — 2026-05-18

### Added

- **Autopilot Studio — the autonomous self-optimizing marketing agent.** Extends v2.4.0's pause-sweep autopilot into a closed compounding loop: give it a website + a spend cap + a few settings, and it researches, generates, pre-analyzes, launches, measures, and self-optimizes — bounded and auditable.
  - **Autonomy as a per-project configurable level** (`marketing.projects.*.autopilot.autonomy_level`): `create_once` (default — = the shipped spend-safety doctrine verbatim: campaign/audience/budget creation is staged under "Requires human action" until a one-time `$STATE_DIR/<project>.create-ok` token unlocks the autonomous daily loop), `sandbox` (creation allowed only when every `envelope` assert passes — `objective_allowlist`, `geo_allowlist`, `max_campaigns`, `max_new_audiences`, post-create Σ budget ≤ `max_daily_budget_usd` ≤ `daily_spend_cap_usd`), `unrestricted` (cap-bounded only; explicitly overrides the default guardrail). `envelope.kill_switch` hard-stops all creation. New `create_object()` gate, sibling of `mutate()`; all object-creation API calls isolated to one auditable gated region.
  - **Creative pre-analysis brain (`scripts/lib/creative/`)** — Tier 0 deterministic (ffmpeg/ffprobe keyframes + tesseract-or-Gemini-Flash OCR; **hard-fails garbled on-asset text**), Tier 1 Gemini 3.1 Pro multimodal (native video+audio) / Gemini Flash + copy compliance via Claude Opus 4.7, Tier 2 Opus 4.7 judge → `PASS|BLOCK|REVISE` + 0–100 prior (hard BLOCK on hallucination/policy), optional Neurons ensemble (off by default). Only a clean asset deploys PAUSED, then bandit swap-in.
  - **Self-learning calibration loop** — `scripts/lib/creative/calibrate.py` (python3 stdlib only) weekly joins the per-project creative ledger to realized KPIs and fits a monotone score→predicted-CPL calibrator; the daily pass ranks live + candidate creatives by calibrated predicted-CPL and does ε-greedy bandit allocation, reusing the existing pause/keep + `min_live_creatives` machinery. Compounds per project. New `marketing-autopilot-calibrate` daemon (`0 9 * * 1` UTC, disabled by default).
  - **Autonomous onboarding** — `source.url` → scrape → derive ICP/value-props/objectives/geo + campaign scaffold via Claude → stage (create_once) or envelope-asserted create (sandbox/unrestricted) → write `campaign_ids` back. New route `/ops:marketing autopilot onboard <url>`.
  - **Gemini gen metered safely** — every Veo 3.1 Fast / Gemini 3.1 Flash-Image generation reserved-under-lock against a separate `daily_gen_spend_cap_usd` (process-global floor, correct under N concurrent; unit-tested). Models default to verified-latest (`veo-3.1-fast-generate-preview`, `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview`, `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, `claude-opus-4-7`).
  - `skills/ops-marketing/SKILL.md`, `skills/setup/channels/marketing.md`, `skills/ops-settings/SKILL.md` — autonomy levels & envelope, Tier 0–3 brain, calibration loop, onboarding; per-project config surfaces. `tests/` — reworked `test-autopilot-cap.sh` (gated-region scan), new `test-autopilot-autonomy.sh` + `test-autopilot-calibrate.py`.
- **Spend-safety unchanged and unconditional:** no `daily_spend_cap_usd` ⇒ refuse; cap pre-flight, runaway `amount_spent` abort, pause-only-down to `min_live_creatives`, first-run/`--dry-run` forced dry, kill_switch, and the metered-gen ceiling all hold regardless of `autonomy_level`. The default (`create_once`) is the v2.4.0 doctrine verbatim — operators consciously opt up; the guardrail is never silently removed.

## [2.4.0] — 2026-05-18

### Added

- **Autonomous ad management ("autopilot") for `/ops:marketing`.** Productizes the per-project autonomous ad optimizer into a reusable, config-driven capability — daily Meta + Google Ads optimization bounded by a mandatory per-project spend cap.
  - `bin/ops-marketing-autopilot` — iterates `marketing.projects.*` where `autopilot.enabled`. Per project/channel: hard cap pre-flight, deterministic worst-first pause sweep (keeps ≥ `min_live_creatives` live), creative-fatigue detection. All money-touching logic is bash (no LLM in the path); creative regeneration + frame hallucination audit + weekly synthesis are delegated to a credit-pool-gated headless `claude_invoke` pass with a self-contained prompt built from project config. Flags: `--dry-run`, `--project`, `--channel`.
  - `scripts/ops-cron-marketing-autopilot.sh` — thin daemon wrapper.
  - `daemon-services.default.json` — new `marketing-autopilot` service (disabled by default, `0 8 * * *` UTC, opt-in via `/ops:setup marketing`).
  - `skills/ops-marketing/SKILL.md` — `autopilot` sub-command route + full doctrine section. `skills/setup/channels/marketing.md` — autopilot opt-in block (spend cap, channels, regen).
  - `tests/test-autopilot-cap.sh` — asserts the spend-safety invariants.
- **Spend-safety (NEVER LEAK MONEY + Rule 5):** no `daily_spend_cap_usd` ⇒ refuse + escalate; Σ campaign budget > cap or runaway `amount_spent` ⇒ abort + escalation note, zero mutations. Autopilot may only pause/swap/regenerate creatives — budget raises, campaign/audience creation, and objective changes are written as human-action recommendations, never executed. `--dry-run` + first install run forced dry.

## [2.3.2] — 2026-05-17

### Changed

- **Docs/wiki/metadata sync for v2.3.x.** Producer side (v2.3.0) and consumer side (v2.3.1) shipped without doc surface updates; v2.3.2 catches everything up.
  - `README.md`: new "Competitor Intelligence (v2.3)" section with pipeline overview, signal-source matrix, consumer integrations, config schema, cost model. Daemon-services list now reflects `competitor-intel` (Mon 10:00), `competitor-alert` (every 10 min), and `competitor-daily` (17:00). `/ops:competitors` added to the skills table. Skill count bumped 30 → 36.
  - `claude-ops/docs/daemon-guide.md`: 3 competitor cron services listed with correct cadence + purpose.
  - `claude-ops/docs/agents-reference.md`: each of `yolo-ceo`/`cto`/`cfo`/`coo` now documents its `competitor_vertical_slice` source and how the slice folds into the analysis.
  - `claude-ops/docs/skills-reference.md`: `/ops:competitors` entry added with all 6 subcommands.
  - Wiki: new `Competitor-Intelligence.md` page covering full architecture + signal sources + severity routing + consumer integrations + state/reports layout + cost model + operational commands. Sidebar updated. Version stamp bumped 2.2.0 → 2.3.2.
  - Skill count drift fixed: `plugin.json` + `marketplace.json` descriptions now say "36 skills, 18 agents" (was "35 skills") to reflect the new `/ops:competitors` skill.

## [2.3.1] — 2026-05-17

### Added

- **Competitor-intel outputs now consumed across the plugin.** v2.3.0 shipped the producer side (signal collectors, severity routing, weekly synthesis). v2.3.1 wires the consumer side so the data actually shows up where decisions get made:

  **Shared context lib** (`scripts/lib/competitor/context.sh`, 292 lines):
  - `competitor_context [--brand X] [--window-days N] [--severity S]` — aggregated JSON with brands list, per-brand state + latest report path, events in window grouped by severity, pending queue sizes.
  - `competitor_briefing_line` — one-line summary for briefing surfaces.
  - `competitor_priority_items --top N` — bullet list of high-severity events for priority advisors.
  - `competitor_vertical_slice <vertical>` — role-filtered slices (`marketing`, `ecom`, `ceo`, `cfo`, `coo`, `cto`) so each consumer gets only what's relevant to its lens.
  - jq-only, no external calls — cheap enough to read on every command invocation.

  **`/ops:go` morning briefing**: new `COMPETITOR` row in `bin/ops-gather` (parallel gather, skipped silently when unconfigured) shows alerts count, med-delta count, last_run, plus top-3 event snippets. Mobile mode compresses to `comp: N alerts (top: brief)`.

  **`/ops:next` priority stack**: high-severity competitor events now slot between `fires` and `unread comms` as Priority 2, framed as `REACT: <competitor> <source> changed — see latest-<brand>.md`. Downstream priorities renumbered 3→6.

  **`/ops:marketing`**: new "Competitor signals (last 7d)" section in dashboard — PRICING MOVES (campaign-react triggers), FUNDING/NEWS (positioning opportunities), SENTIMENT (Reddit/HN themes). Skipped when slice is empty.

  **`/ops:ecom`**: new "Competitor activity (last 7d)" section — APP RELEASES (App Store version snapshots), PRODUCT/PRICING CHANGES (feature + pricing page diffs).

  **`/ops:yolo` C-suite agents**: each of CEO/CTO/CFO/COO agent files (`agents/yolo-{ceo,cto,cfo,coo}.md`) now sources `competitor_vertical_slice <role>` and weaves role-specific signals into their analysis. CEO sees new entrants + funding; CFO sees pricing diffs with money tokens; COO sees Greenhouse/Lever hiring signals; CTO sees changelog/feature page-diffs.

  **New `/ops:competitors` skill** + `bin/ops-competitors` CLI:
  - Dashboard mode (no args): all tracked brands with alert counts, last_run, recent high events.
  - Drill-down (`ops-competitors <brand>`): 30d event timeline, top competitors, latest report excerpt.
  - `refresh [brand]` — manually trigger the weekly cron immediately, optional per-brand env override.
  - `add-url <brand> <competitor> <kind> <url>` — jq-merges a page-diff URL into `preferences.json` with confirm prompt.
  - `alerts` — tail last 20 of `reports/competitor-intel/alerts.log`.
  - Mobile-aware rendering, no external deps beyond curl + jq.

## [2.3.0] — 2026-05-17

### Added

- **Competitor-intel v2.3 — full pipeline redesign with 5 signal sources, severity-tiered routing, and append-only event log.** Goes from "weekly Tavily dump + Sonnet synth" to a real CI system that rivals Crayon/Klue/Kompyte's signal breadth at $0 incremental cost.

  **New signal collectors** (`scripts/lib/competitor/`, all bash + jq + curl, no extra deps):
  - `reddit-search.sh` — Reddit JSON API (no auth), severity-classified by score + keyword heuristics (complaint, vs, alternative, switching from).
  - `hn-search.sh` — HN Algolia API (no auth), severity by points + comments + Show HN/Launch HN/is hiring detection.
  - `appstore-lookup.sh` — Apple iTunes Lookup API (no auth), version + rating + release-date snapshots for mobile competitors (opt-in via `preferences.json .competitor_intel.app_store: true`).
  - `jobs-feed.sh` — Greenhouse + Lever public job APIs (no auth), strategic-hire detection (VP / Head of / Director / Chief / Founding → high severity).
  - `page-diff.sh` — HTML pricing/features/careers/changelog page-diff engine. Fetches with curl, normalizes via Python (strip script/style/svg, decode entities, collapse whitespace), SHA-256, persists snapshots to `competitor_state/<brand>/<comp>/snapshots/<kind>.<sha8>.txt` with `<kind>.latest` symlink. Diffs emit lines-changed + extracted snippet. Severity: pricing-page change with money token (`$`, `€`, `/mo`, `/yr`) → high; other pricing/features/changelog → med; tiny copy tweaks → low. Last 12 snapshots retained per kind.

  **Severity-tiered routing** (`scripts/lib/competitor/event-router.sh` + 2 new crons):
  - All events append to `competitor_state/events.jsonl` (audit log).
  - `severity: high` → also writes to `queue/immediate.jsonl`, drained every 10min by `ops-competitor-alert.sh` (Telegram push if creds + always `alerts.log`).
  - `severity: med` → `queue/daily.jsonl`, drained at 17:00 by `ops-cron-competitor-daily.sh` (grouped-by-competitor roll-up, dated daily-YYYY-MM-DD.md + Telegram digest with 4000-char cap).
  - `severity: low` → state-only, surfaced in weekly strategic synthesis.

  **Weekly cron pipeline rewrite** (`ops-cron-competitor-intel.sh`, 432 lines):
  - Discovery cached 30d (skips Tavily when state has fresh `last_discovery`, saving ~60% Tavily spend).
  - Per-competitor signals collected in parallel background jobs with 30s timeout guards; page-diff URLs read per-competitor from `preferences.json .competitor_intel.urls.<competitor>`.
  - Reads 7d window of `events.jsonl` (jq epoch filter) and merges into Sonnet prompt (capped at 100k chars).
  - Raw synthesis always persisted to `reports/competitor-intel/YYYY-MM-DD_<brand>-synthesis.md` BEFORE extraction so partial LLM output is never lost.
  - State extended with `last_discovery` and `app_store_enabled` keys (backward compat with v2.2.5 `competitors` + `last_run` preserved).
  - Graceful degradation: missing `TAVILY_API_KEY` AND no cached state → SKIP cleanly; missing Tavily but cached state present → proceed with non-Tavily signals only.

  **Daemon services config** — `competitor-alert` (`*/10 * * * *`) and `competitor-daily` (`0 17 * * *`) added to `daemon-services.default.json` and `daemon-services.example.json` alongside existing weekly `competitor-intel` (`0 10 * * 1` Europe/Amsterdam).

  **Cost model at 10-brand scale**: ~13 Tavily calls/wk total (cached discovery), ~320k Sonnet tokens/mo on Max-OAuth — $0 incremental.

## [2.2.5] — 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- **`competitor-intel` LLM synth dropped to raw Tavily fallback when output didn't include `---REPORT---` marker.** Sonnet was producing valid strategic deltas but the strict marker check threw them away. Three-strategy JSON extraction now: (1) fenced ` ```json ` block, (2) bare `{"competitors":[...]}` regex anywhere in output, (3) bullet-list scrape from "NEW entrants" / "Competitor moves" sections. Report extraction now falls back to stripping JSON blocks from full synthesis instead of dropping to raw Tavily dump.
- **Weekly reports invisible without Telegram bot configured.** Cron now writes every report to `$DATA_DIR/reports/competitor-intel/YYYY-MM-DD_<brand>.md` and maintains a `latest-<brand>.md` symlink. Telegram push is now additive — disk write happens unconditionally, even when bot creds are missing.

## [2.2.4] — 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- **Daemon silent crash-loop under launchd.** `scripts/ops-daemon.sh` included `com.claude-ops.daemon` in its own `EXPECTED_SERVICES` self-healing list. On startup the ENSURE loop read its own previous launchctl `exit=1` status (a normal post-install state), called `launchctl kickstart "gui/$UID/com.claude-ops.daemon"`, received SIGTERM, and respawned every ~30s via launchd's `ThrottleInterval`. Net effect: no `daemon-health.json` refresh, no service supervision, no message-listener, but `launchctl list` showed the entry registered with exit=1, no PID. Removed `com.claude-ops.daemon` from `EXPECTED_SERVICES` (launchd's `KeepAlive=true` already handles auto-restart). Also removed the decommissioned `com.claude-ops.wacli-keepalive` entry — it was a v2.0.3 leftover whose plist no longer ships, causing noisy "cannot repair — missing bash or source plist" log entries every monitor cycle. `install_daemon_launchd()` cleaned up to stop trying to install the non-existent wacli plist. (#241)

## [2.2.3] — 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- **Doppler MCP server failed to connect on every reload.** Plugin's `.mcp.json` invoked `npx -y @dopplerhq/mcp-server` which tries to run a binary matching the package name. The actual bin is `doppler-mcp` (`bin: { "doppler-mcp": "bin/doppler-mcp" }`), so npx couldn't find a command and exited with `command not found`. Switched to `npx -y -p @dopplerhq/mcp-server doppler-mcp` form which explicitly names the binary, eliminating the `Failed to connect` error from `/reload-plugins`.

## [2.2.2] — 2026-05-16

### Changed

- **`competitor-intel` cron rewritten as self-discovering LLM-driven analyzer.** Previous version posted Telegram digests from 2 hardcoded queries (`COMPETITOR_A_QUERY`, `COMPETITOR_B_QUERY`, `BRAND_QUERY`) that `/ops:setup` never collected — every Monday at 10am the cron broadcast placeholder garbage like `"competitor-a reviews 2026"`. New pipeline: Tavily discovery pass auto-surfaces the current competitor landscape for `{brand_name}` in `{category}`; diffs against persisted `competitor_state.json` to flag NEW entrants week-over-week; runs per-competitor news searches (pricing/launches/funding/layoffs, last 7d); brand-mention pass; Sonnet synthesis (`claude_invoke`, ~5–10k tokens/week against Max-OAuth, no API billing) produces a one-page strategic delta with NEW entrants / competitor moves / brand signal / threats & opportunities. Graceful degradation: missing `TAVILY_API_KEY` → SKIP and exit 0; missing `claude_invoke` or empty LLM response → raw Tavily fallback. (#237)
- **`/ops:setup` gates `competitor-intel` per Rule 3.** Step 5b-i now asks `[Configure now]` / `[Skip — disable]` instead of always-enabling. Configure path collects 2 free-text values (`brand_name`, `category`) — system auto-discovers competitors instead of hardcoding them. Skip path sets `enabled: false` in `daemon-services.json`. (#234, #237)

### Schema

- `preferences.json` `.competitor_intel` shape changed:
  - **Before:** `{competitor_a_query, competitor_b_query, brand_query, report_timezone}`
  - **After:** `{brand_name, category, max_competitors, report_timezone}` (cron auto-discovers; state persisted at `$DATA_DIR/competitor_state.json`)

## [2.2.1] — 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- **Plugin load error: `marketplace.json` rejected by validator.** Removed unsupported `screenshots` key from `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. `claude plugin validate` was reporting `Unrecognized key: "screenshots"` and the Claude Code loader surfaced this as an error on `/reload-plugins`.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- **Plugin installation blocked by unsupported `enum` keys in `plugin.json`.** Claude Code's plugin validator rejects `enum` as an unrecognized key in userConfig fields. Removed `enum` from 7 fields (`fix_model`, `max_fixes_per_hour`, `watcher_timeout_seconds`, `notify_channel`, `task_reminder_threshold`, `aws_region`, `doppler_config`) and moved allowed values into descriptions.
- **`ops-package` SKILL.md YAML frontmatter parse error.** Unquoted colon in description field caused YAML parse failure, silently dropping all frontmatter metadata at runtime. Wrapped in quotes.
- **Version number alignment.** Synchronized version across `plugin.json` (was 2.0.6), `package.json` (was 1.7.2), and `marketplace.json` (was 2.0.6) to 2.2.0.
- **Plugin description counts updated.** Changed "30 skills, 14 agents" to "35 skills, 18 agents" to match actual inventory.
- **Deploy-fix test suite: 45/45 passing (was 39/45).** Refactored `dispatch_fix_agent` from template-based (`prompts/*.md`) to agent-based dispatch (`claude --agent <name>`). Fixed `is_transient` regex line continuations. Fixed `resolve_health_url`/`resolve_version_url` multi-`local` cross-references. Updated test cases to use real agent names (`build-fixer`, `deploy-fixer`).
- **`set -e` safety for `locate_repo` and `resolve_*` functions.** Added `|| true` guards so `locate_repo` returning 1 no longer aborts `ops-deploy-fix-build-trigger` under `set -e`. Added explicit `return 0` to `resolve_health_url` and `resolve_version_url`.
- **Account rotation stdin handling.** Fixed `claude -p` subprocess invocation in `bulk-setup-token.mjs` and `kapture-claim-credits.mjs` to explicitly close stdin via `stdio: ['ignore','pipe','pipe']`, preventing newer CLI versions from warning about missing stdin.

## [2.0.6] — 2026-04-30

### Added

- **`/ops:credentials` skill + `bin/ops-credentials` audit CLI.** Scans shell env, ops preferences.json, Doppler (resolves `doppler:KEY` references live), macOS Keychain, and Dashlane to report which integration credentials are configured vs missing. Output formats: human table (default), JSON (`--json`), single-service filter (`--service stripe`). Values masked as `first6•••last4`; never prints raw secrets. Auto-switches to compact one-line-per-cred format on SSH/mobile (`$SSH_CONNECTION` or `$OPS_MOBILE=1` per Rule 7). Solves the "Claude Code settings UI can't see my keychain" problem — users can now check at a glance which integrations are ready to use.
- **Credential field hints in plugin.json descriptions.** All 22 credential fields now include "If already configured via /ops:setup or stored in keychain/Doppler, leave blank — runtime resolves automatically" in their description, so users don't waste time pasting values that are already in scope.

## [2.0.5] — 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- **Plugin settings UI: enums + sensitive flags.** Added `enum` to every userConfig field with a finite known value space — `fix_model` (opus/sonnet/haiku), `notify_channel` (macos/ntfy/pushover/discord/telegram/none), `aws_region` (16 regions), `max_fixes_per_hour` (1/3/5/10), `task_reminder_threshold` (5/10/20/50), `watcher_timeout_seconds` (5min–1hr buckets), `doppler_config` (dev/stg/prd/ci). Marked 22 credential fields `sensitive: true` so the settings UI masks them: Telegram api_hash/session, Klaviyo, Meta Ads, Shopify admin, ShipBob, Bland AI, ElevenLabs, Groq, Stripe, RevenueCat, Datadog, New Relic, Pushover, Discord bot/webhook, Doppler token, DPD password, UPS/FedEx client secrets. Remaining text inputs are user-specific identifiers (Sentry org slug, Linear team key, store URLs, account/customer IDs) with no enumerable value space — freeform text is correct for those.

## [2.0.4] — 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- **Registry path resolution: survive plugin updates.** Bin scripts read `registry.json` from `$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/registry.json` (the cache path), which is wiped on every plugin upgrade. Symptom: after a version bump, `/ops:ops-dash` and friends report "No project registry found" until the user manually re-runs `/ops:setup`, even though their data-dir registry is intact. Introduced `lib/registry-path.sh` that resolves `OPS_DATA_DIR` and `REGISTRY` with precedence: data-dir → caller-supplied legacy fallback → `$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts` → canonical default. Patched `bin/ops-dash`, `ops-merge-scan`, `ops-ci`, `ops-external`, `ops-infra`, `ops-prs`, `ops-git`, `ops-doctor`, `ops-setup-detect`, and `scripts/ops-daemon.sh::prefetch_project_health`. `bin/ops-projects` already followed this pattern; this brings the rest of the surface in line. (#180)

## [2.0.3] — 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- **Daemon: WhatsApp state now reads from Baileys bridge `messages.db` directly.** Removed last 4 references to deprecated `wacli_chats.json` / `wacli_urgent.json` keepalive caches in `scripts/ops-daemon.sh` (briefing refresh, urgent-message detection, smart memory trigger, contact activity index). Briefings no longer surface false "WhatsApp disconnected" warnings when the bridge is healthy.

### Added

- **`bin/ops-post-update-migrate`: auto-fire migrations on plugin update.** Wired into `hooks/hooks.json` SessionStart and `scripts/ops-daemon-manager.sh ensure-current`. Idempotent, gated by per-version sentinel (`$DATA_DIR/.migrated/v<VERSION>`), wall-clock budget 60s. Currently runs: `whatsapp-bridge-migrate.sh` (FTS5 + contacts), refreshes `com.claude-ops.whatsapp-bridge` LaunchAgent, decommissions stale `com.claude-ops.wacli-keepalive` plist. Future migrations chain into `run_migrations()`.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-04-27

### Changed

- **Decommission wacli daemon. WhatsApp ops now Baileys-only via `mcp__whatsapp__*`.** Migration script in `scripts/whatsapp-bridge-migrate.sh`.
  - All skill references to `wacli chats list`, `wacli messages list/search`, `wacli contacts --search`, `wacli send`, `wacli history backfill`, and `wacli doctor` replaced with `mcp__whatsapp__*` tool calls or direct `sqlite3` queries against the bridge `messages.db`.
  - `scripts/wacli-keepalive.sh` and `scripts/com.claude-ops.wacli-keepalive.plist` moved to `legacy/` (preserved for reference).
  - `bin/wacli-health` rewritten to check bridge port 8080 and launchd status.
  - `bin/wacli-safe` replaced with a deprecation shim.
  - New `bin/ops-pretool-whatsapp-bridge-health` PreToolUse hook for bridge liveness.
  - New `assets/launchagents/com.${USER}.whatsapp-bridge.plist` template.
  - `scripts/whatsapp-bridge-migrate.sh`: idempotent FTS5 virtual table + contacts table migration for `messages.db`; seeds contacts from macOS Contacts.app via osascript.

### Migration steps (manual, post-merge)

1. Run `scripts/whatsapp-bridge-migrate.sh` to add FTS5 index and contacts table to bridge `messages.db`.
2. Revoke the wacli linked device on your phone (WhatsApp → Settings → Linked Devices).
3. `launchctl bootout gui/$UID ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claude-ops.wacli-keepalive.plist 2>/dev/null || true`
4. `rm -f ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claude-ops.wacli-keepalive.plist`

### Rollback

WhatsApp supports 4 linked devices. Re-link wacli at any time:

```bash
wacli auth   # scan QR
launchctl bootstrap gui/$UID ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claude-ops.wacli-keepalive.plist
```

History from before rollback won't be in new wacli store, but bridge keeps running independently — no message loss.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-04-26

> **Major release.** Purely additive — no behavior of any v1.x skill changes by default. Existing users can upgrade in place. Every new subsystem is gated by a `userConfig` toggle (defaults documented per-feature below) and can be turned off from `/plugins` settings without uninstalling. See [`docs/migrating-from-v1.md`](docs/migrating-from-v1.md) and the [Migrating-from-v1 wiki page](https://github.com/Lifecycle-Innovations-Limited/claude-ops/wiki/Migrating-from-v1).

### Headline

v2.0 turns claude-ops from a _briefing + comms surface_ into an **autonomy layer** for Claude Code itself. It now:

1. Watches every `gh pr merge` you run, follows the deploy workflow, audits service health + verifies the served commit, and dispatches a Haiku **deploy-fixer** if anything goes wrong (PR #158).
2. Watches every `npm run build:*`, parses the failure, and dispatches a Haiku **build-fixer** (PR #158).
3. Pre-installs four specialist subagents (`general-purpose`, `deploy-fixer`, `build-fixer`, `dependency-auditor`) and silently swaps `general-purpose` → matching specialist via a PreToolUse hook on `Agent` (PRs #161, #162).
4. Ships three universal **safety hooks** that block the most common foot-guns: secrets-in-staged-diff, `rm -rf` against anchor paths, and direct `git push` to `main` (PR #163).
5. Periodically nudges Claude to use `Task*` tools when a session has gone N tool calls without one (PR #163).
6. Runs a **recap marquee daemon** that synthesises a one-line digest across all parallel Claude sessions and surfaces it in tmux `status-right` or the Claude Code `statusLine` (PR #160).
7. Folds in a **multi-account Claude Max rotator** with launchd daemon + AI-brain heuristics so you never blow a weekly cap (PR #160).
8. Expands `/ops:setup` with steps 2d, 3o, and 6.5a–6.5d so every new subsystem has a guided wizard.
9. Overhauls `plugin.json` `userConfig` so 19+ entries render as proper spacebar-toggle booleans / numeric caps / file pickers in `/plugins` settings (PR #164).
10. Adds two new test scripts (`tests/test-deploy-fix-hooks.sh`, `tests/test-safety-hooks.sh`) wired into `tests/run-all.sh` (PR #163).

### Added

#### 1. Deploy auto-fix subsystem — `/ops:deploy-fix` (PR #158)

The flagship v2 feature. Watches your merges and your local builds; verifies the result; auto-fixes failures.

- **`hooks/hooks.json` PostToolUse:Bash → `bin/ops-deploy-fix-merge-trigger`** — fires on `gh pr merge *`, parses repo + PR + base + sha, spawns `scripts/ops-deploy-monitor.sh` in the background. The monitor:
  1. Polls the deploy GitHub Actions workflow until completion (regex configurable via `deploy_workflow_pattern`, default `deploy|Deploy|build|Build|ECS|cd|CD`).
  2. On success: optionally `curl`s the service `/health` URL and verifies `/version` returns the merged SHA.
  3. On failure: classifies as **transient** (npm registry blip, rate limit, network timeout) and `gh run rerun`s, OR dispatches a headless Haiku `deploy-fixer` agent with the failing log tail injected into [`prompts/deploy-fix.md`](prompts/deploy-fix.md).
- **`hooks/hooks.json` PostToolUse:Bash → `bin/ops-deploy-fix-build-trigger`** — fires on `npm run build:*`, parses the local build script output, dispatches a Haiku `build-fixer` agent with [`prompts/build-fix.md`](prompts/build-fix.md). Single-flight per repo.
- **`scripts/lib/deploy-fix-common.sh`** — shared library: single-flight lock acquisition, per-repo hourly budget cap (default 3, see `max_fixes_per_hour`), content-hash dedup, transient classifier, notify dispatcher.
- **Layered service registry**: project `.claude/post-merge-services.json` → user `~/.claude/config/post-merge-services.json` → plugin `config/post-merge-services.example.json`. Maps `owner/repo:base` → `{ health_url, version_url, deploy_workflow }`.
- **Notification channel** (`notify_channel` userConfig): `macos` (osascript), `ntfy` (ntfy.sh topic), `pushover`, `discord` webhook, `telegram`, or `none`.
- **`/ops:deploy-fix` skill** — `status` (live runs, today's history, budget remaining), `tail <run-id>` (stream the monitor log), `configure` (open the registry), `test` (dry-run the hook against a synthetic merge).
- **userConfig toggles** (all spacebar-toggleable in `/plugins` settings): `deploy_fix_enabled`, `monitor_post_merge`, `monitor_build_failures`, `auto_dispatch_fixer`, `allow_dangerous`, `auto_rerun_transients`, `audit_health_after_deploy`, `verify_served_commit`, `fix_model`, `max_fixes_per_hour`, `watcher_timeout_seconds`, `registry_path`, `repo_search_roots`, `deploy_workflow_pattern`, `notify_channel`. See [`docs/deploy-fix.md`](docs/deploy-fix.md) for the full table with defaults.

#### 2. Specialized agent system (PRs #161, #162)

- [`agents/general-purpose.md`](agents/general-purpose.md) — local override that limits the default agent to research and read-only investigation.
- [`agents/deploy-fixer.md`](agents/deploy-fixer.md) — single-shot SRE persona invoked by the deploy auto-fix subsystem.
- [`agents/build-fixer.md`](agents/build-fixer.md) — focused TypeScript/bundler error fixer for local build failures.
- [`agents/dependency-auditor.md`](agents/dependency-auditor.md) — runs `npm audit` / `pip-audit` / SCA equivalents and proposes minimal upgrades.
- **`bin/ops-suggest-specialized-agent`** — PreToolUse hook on `Agent`. When `subagent_type=general-purpose`, inspects the prompt against [`config/specialist-keywords.example.json`](config/specialist-keywords.example.json) (also user-extensible at `~/.claude/config/specialist-keywords.json`) and **silently swaps** to the matching specialist via `updatedInput`. If no match, fires a Haiku drafter that proposes a brand-new agent file under `~/.claude/agents/`.
- **userConfig**: `suggest_specialized_agents` (default `true`).
- **Deep dive**: [`docs/agents.md`](docs/agents.md).

#### 3. Universal safety hooks (PR #163)

Three PreToolUse:Bash hooks. Always-on by design; per-hook escape via `permissionDecision`.

- **`bin/ops-prevent-secret-commit`** — denies `git commit` when the staged diff matches secret patterns (AWS keys, GitHub PATs, Slack tokens, OpenAI/Anthropic keys, `.env` content).
- **`bin/ops-no-rm-rf-anchor`** — denies `rm -rf` when the resolved target is `/`, `~`, `$HOME`, `..`, or `.`. Symlink-resolved before the check.
- **`bin/ops-warn-mainpush`** — fires `permissionDecision: ask` when the user runs `git push` and the current branch is `main`/`master`/`prod`/`production`.
- **Deep dive**: [`docs/safety-hooks.md`](docs/safety-hooks.md).

#### 4. Universal Task\* tracking nudge (PR #163)

- **`bin/ops-task-reminder`** — PostToolUse `*` hook. Increments a session-scoped counter on every non-Task tool call. When the counter exceeds `task_reminder_threshold` (default `10`), emits a single `additionalContext` line nudging Claude to use `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` / `TaskList`. Counter resets when any `Task*` tool fires.
- **userConfig**: `task_reminder_enabled` (default `true`), `task_reminder_threshold` (default `10`, range `3..50`).

#### 5. Recap marquee daemon — `/ops:recap` (PR #160)

- **`scripts/recap/daemon.sh`** — long-lived loop, every 30s reads tool-activity logs from `hooks/recap-tool-activity.sh` + per-session captures from `hooks/recap-capture.sh`.
- **`scripts/recap/digest.sh`** — synthesises the digest (active session count, latest action per session, fire flags).
- **`scripts/recap/marquee.sh`** — formats the digest as a one-line ANSI string for tmux `status-right`.
- **`templates/com.claude-ops.recap-daemon.plist`** — launchd unit; systemd alternative documented inline in [`docs/recap.md`](docs/recap.md).
- **`/ops:recap` skill** — `status`, `tail`, `configure`, `restart`.
- **`/ops:setup` step 2d** — auto-appends the marquee source to `~/.tmux.conf` (or wires the Claude Code `statusLine` if no tmux is detected).
- **userConfig**: `recap_marquee_enabled` (default `true`), `recap_marquee_auto_configure_tmux` (default `true`).

#### 6. Multi-account Claude Max rotator — `/ops:rotate` + `/ops:rotate-setup` (PR #160)

- **`scripts/account-rotation/rotate.mjs`** — swaps the `Claude Code-credentials` keychain entry to the next configured account.
- **`scripts/account-rotation/daemon.mjs`** — launchd-managed; polls each account's usage every N minutes and rotates _before_ hitting the cap.
- **`scripts/account-rotation/ai-brain.mjs`** — Haiku-powered heuristic that decides which account to rotate to based on remaining quota + recent usage trajectory.
- **`scripts/account-rotation/setup-account.mjs`** — OAuth init for one account.
- **`scripts/account-rotation/force-rotate.sh`** — manual override.
- **`templates/com.claude-ops.account-rotation.plist`** — launchd unit.
- **`/ops:rotate`** — manual rotate. **`/ops:rotate-setup`** — interactive multi-account onboarding.
- **`/ops:setup` step 3o** — walks through OAuth init for every configured account that lacks a keychain token.
- **userConfig**: `account_rotation_enabled` (default `false` — opt-in), `account_rotation_setup_oauth_each` (default `true`).
- **Hard guardrail**: rotator refuses any account with overage billing enabled unless `--allow-extra-usage` is passed.

#### 7. `/ops:setup` wizard — new steps

- **Step 2d** — recap marquee install + tmux/`statusLine` configuration.
- **Step 3o** — Claude Max account OAuth init loop (one prompt per configured account).
- **Step 6.5a** — deploy auto-fix toggle + registry path picker.
- **Step 6.5b** — recap marquee toggle.
- **Step 6.5c** — task reminder toggle + threshold.
- **Step 6.5d** — account rotator toggle.

#### 8. `plugin.json` userConfig overhaul (PR #164)

19+ new entries. Existing string entries swept to proper types so they render correctly in `/plugins` settings:

- `ga4_property_id`, `newrelic_account_id` — `string` → `number`.
- `aws_region` — description improved with valid options.
- All new toggles use `type: boolean` with explicit `default` so they're spacebar-toggleable.
- All new caps use `type: number` with `min`/`max`.
- `registry_path` uses `type: file` for native file picker.

#### 9. Test suite expansion (PR #163)

- **`tests/test-deploy-fix-hooks.sh`** — 39 assertions across 11 cases (trigger detection, transient classification, dedup, budget cap, single-flight lock, registry layering, notify dispatch).
- **`tests/test-safety-hooks.sh`** — 45/45 pass (each safety hook gets positive + negative tests).
- Both wired into `tests/run-all.sh`.

#### 10. New documentation

- [`docs/deploy-fix.md`](docs/deploy-fix.md), [`docs/agents.md`](docs/agents.md), [`docs/safety-hooks.md`](docs/safety-hooks.md), [`docs/recap.md`](docs/recap.md), [`docs/migrating-from-v1.md`](docs/migrating-from-v1.md), [`docs/INDEX.md`](docs/INDEX.md).
- Wiki: `Auto-Fix-Subsystem`, `Specialized-Agents`, `Safety-Hooks`, `Recap-Marquee`, `Multi-Account-Rotator`, `Migrating-from-v1` (new); `Home`, `Sidebar`, `Setup-Wizard`, `Configuration` (updated).

### Changed

- **Default agent for tool dispatch** is no longer raw `general-purpose`. The PreToolUse hook now silently routes via the specialist keyword map. To restore v1 behaviour, set `suggest_specialized_agents: false`.
- **`/ops:setup`** has six new steps (2d, 3o, 6.5a, 6.5b, 6.5c, 6.5d). Existing steps are unchanged.
- **`plugin.json` description + keywords** rewritten to mention the v2 surface.
- **`README.md` + `claude-ops/README.md`** front-load a "What's new in v2.0" section before the existing feature list.

### Migration

**No breaking changes.** Every v2 subsystem is opt-out via a `userConfig` toggle. Existing v1 settings, registries, preferences, and daemon services are unchanged. Upgrade in place:

```bash
# inside Claude Code:
/plugin update ops@lifecycle-innovations-limited-claude-ops
/ops:setup   # walks through the 6 new steps; safe to skip any
```

See [`docs/migrating-from-v1.md`](docs/migrating-from-v1.md) for the full v1 → v2 reference.

## [1.8.1] — 2026-04-26

### Fixed

- **`scripts/wacli-keepalive.sh` — `refresh_wacli_cache` cold-restarted the keepalive every cache cycle.** `refresh_wacli_cache` called `release_wacli_batch` after killing `--follow` to refresh the chats/urgent caches, which removed `BATCH_MARKER`. The supervisor's exit-detect (line 567) saw the marker missing and treated the kill as a clean shutdown instead of a deliberate self-pause, breaking out of the while-loop and letting launchd cold-restart the script with a fresh bootstrap sync. Symptom: persistent `wacli sync --follow` could not stay alive longer than ~15 minutes; the daemon was effectively in a restart loop disguised as healthy backfill cycles. Fix: omit `release_wacli_batch` in `refresh_wacli_cache`, matching the deliberate behavior already documented in `periodic_backfill`. The supervisor's pre-restart `rm -f "$BATCH_MARKER"` (line 571) handles cleanup.
- **`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — plugin version pin lagged `plugin.json`.** v1.8.0 bumped `claude-ops/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` but missed the version field in the marketplace manifest at the repo root, so users discovering the plugin via the marketplace still saw `1.7.1`. Now both files agree.

## [1.8.0] — 2026-04-26

### Added

- **Superpowers integration across `/ops:ops-merge`, `/ops:ops-orchestrate`, `/ops:ops-triage`.** Each skill now invokes specific `superpowers:*` skills at well-defined checkpoints to enforce stronger guardrails:
  - `ops-merge` calls `superpowers:verification-before-completion` + `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` before the final merge decision (after fixer reports green) so nothing ships half-done.
  - `ops-orchestrate` calls `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents` when launching 2+ parallel teammates per wave, enforcing file-ownership boundaries and task-independence checks.
  - `ops-triage` calls `superpowers:systematic-debugging` during root-cause investigation so fix agents target the real defect, not the symptom.
- **`/ops:setup` Step 2b.5 — installs the `superpowers` plugin.** Mirrors the existing GSD install step: detects whether `superpowers` is already present, prompts the user, runs `claude plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace && claude plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace`, and falls back to a direct `git clone` of the marketplace if the `claude` CLI is unavailable. Skipping is fine — the superpower checkpoints become no-ops without it.

### Fixed

- **`bin/ops-autofix` — `wacli-health` killed the legitimate `wacli sync --follow` daemon every run.** The auto-fix unconditionally killed any process holding the wacli store lock, despite a comment promising a `>2 min` age check that was never implemented. `wacli sync --follow` legitimately holds the lock for its entire lifetime to stream live messages, so every `/ops:ops-doctor` invocation cold-restarted the keepalive and broke message reception. The fix:
  - Skips the kill outright when the lock holder's command matches `wacli sync --follow`.
  - Implements the >2 min age check the comment promised, parsing `ps etime` formats `SS`, `MM:SS`, `HH:MM:SS`, and `DD-HH:MM:SS`.
  - Logs cmd + age when killing for traceability, and logs skips with a reason (young vs `--follow`) instead of silently passing through.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-04-18

### Added

- **`/gtm` — cross-channel go-to-market planning skill** (PR #141). New `ops-gtm` skill acts as a strategy layer on top of `/marketing`. Guides the operator through GTM intake (audience, positioning, constraints, targets), generates a full plan across paid, unpaid, sales, and AI-automation avenues, and persists dated plan/brief files under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR}/gtm/`. Plan items hand off to `/marketing` sub-commands via the `Skill` tool so credential resolution and API calls stay single-sourced. Approval gates are enforced for every paid or outbound action.
- **`ops-memory-extractor` — Claude Code OAuth support** (PR #138). The background memory extractor now prefers the Claude Code OAuth token stored in macOS Keychain (service `Claude Code-credentials`) over `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Calls use `Authorization: Bearer <oauth-token>` with the `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20` header, billed against the user's Claude Max subscription instead of their API credit. Falls back to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (env → keychain `anthropic-api-key` → Doppler `sharedsecrets/prd`). The OAuth token is never exported to the shell environment, avoiding the Claude Code misbehavior that occurs when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in a parent terminal session.
- **`/ops:projects` — portfolio dashboard** (PR #139). Renders a dashboard of every project in the GSD registry, including active phase, task count, dirty-file count, and open-PR status. Reads from `$OPS_DATA_DIR/registry.json` synced by `scripts/ops-gsd-registry-sync.sh`.
- **`ops-speedup` v2 parity — GPU/ANE monitoring and power-hog detection** (PR #140). Full feature parity with the v1 bash script: `--gpu` reports GPU + Neural Engine utilization via `powermetrics` (macOS) with sampling-window controls, `--power` surfaces top energy consumers from `top -o pmem` / `ps -eo`, `--os-actions` performs cross-platform kernel_task / WindowServer restarts and launchd service masking behind an allowlist.

### Fixed

- **`scripts/wacli-keepalive.sh` — persistent `--follow` connection torn down by immediate backfill** (PR #138, reported via daemon log audit). The supervisor was invoking `wacli sync --once` on the very first supervisor tick before `--follow` had stabilized its store lock, which terminated the persistent connection within ~5-20 minutes every time. Added `INITIAL_BACKFILL_DELAY=30` seconds after follower start before the first `--once` sweep, and introduced `_WACLI_BATCH_HELD` reentrant guards to prevent overlapping sweeps. The `ops-daemon` now keeps `wacli --follow` alive indefinitely.
- **`bin/ops-speedup` — `eval` on user-controlled strings** (PR #140, SEV-9 from Seer). Replaced `eval` with `declare -g` plus a string allowlist to close a shell-injection vector in the OS-action dispatcher.
- **`bin/ops-speedup` — RETURN-trap race** (PR #140, SEV-8). Temp files previously leaked if the function returned mid-trap; now scoped with a local trap per function and cleared on the success path.
- **`bin/ops-speedup` — systemd mask without allowlist** (PR #140, SEV-8). The Linux path now validates the service name against a static allowlist before calling `systemctl mask`, preventing accidental masking of critical services.
- **`bin/ops-speedup` — `lsof +D` wedged the probe on large dirs** (PR #140, SEV-7). Replaced `+D` (recursive descent) with a bounded file-list argument so the liveness check returns in under 200 ms on any realistic directory.
- **`bin/ops-speedup` — non-portable `mktemp`, awk field reorder, and `find` precedence** (PR #140, SEV-low trio). `mktemp` now passes an explicit template for BSD/GNU compatibility, the awk power-hog formatter orders by `%MEM` before `%CPU` (matching the help text), and `find` predicates are correctly parenthesized.
- **`bin/ops-projects` — hardcoded developer registry path** (PR #139, SEV-9 blocker from Seer + blocksorg + cursor + devin + codex). The inline Python heredoc hardcoded `/Users/<user>/…/registry.json` inside a single-quoted heredoc, so the `$REGISTRY` shell variable never expanded and the dashboard printed `(no registry)` for every other user. Rewrote to read `OPS_DATA_DIR` from the environment inside the Python block (`import os; registry = Path(os.environ.get("OPS_DATA_DIR", os.path.expanduser("~/.claude/plugins/data/ops-ops-marketplace"))) / "registry.json"`). Also violated `CLAUDE.md Rule 0` (public repo, no personal paths).
- **`scripts/daemon-services.default.json` — three services enabled without backing scripts** (PR #139, SEV-7 from blocksorg). `inbox-digest`, `message-listener`, and `competitor-intel` were default-enabled but their scripts were not shipped in the diff, so `message-listener` (with `max_restarts: 20`) would have log-spammed 20 restart attempts. Set `enabled: false` for all three; the daemon reconciles them back to `true` once the user configures the relevant channel during `/ops:setup`.
- **`skills/ops-projects/SKILL.md` — `AskUserQuestion` removed from `allowed-tools` but still referenced in body** (PR #139, SEV-7 from blocksorg). Added `AskUserQuestion` back to the allowed-tools frontmatter so the interactive deep-dive flow doesn't crash with `InputValidationError`.

## [1.6.2] — 2026-04-16

### Fixed

- **`bin/ops-marketing-dash` — empty data from background gatherers** (sentry[bot] + cursor[bot], HIGH). `VAR=$(fn) &` with `wait` only assigns inside the backgrounded subshell, so `KLAVIYO_DATA`, `META_DATA`, `GA4_DATA`, `GSC_DATA`, `GADS_DATA`, and `INSTAGRAM_DATA` were all empty after `wait`. Switched to the tempfile pattern already used in `bin/ops-external` / `bin/ops-discover-external`.
- **`bin/ops-marketing-dash` — hardcoded `EMAIL_SCORE=10`** (cursor[bot]). Now derived from Klaviyo last-campaign `open_rate` (≥20% → 20pt, ≥10% → 10pt, else 0), matching the thresholds documented in `skills/ops-marketing/SKILL.md §Marketing Health Score`. `gather_klaviyo` now fetches campaign-values-reports for the most recent campaign.
- **`bin/ops-marketing-dash` — active-channel count used string compare** (cursor[bot] + codex[bot]). After the tempfile fix, unconfigured gatherers emit JSON `null`, so the literal `!= "0"` test mis-counted. Replaced with a numeric `is_positive` awk helper.
- **`skills/ops-marketing/SKILL.md` — Meta ad creative passed ad account ID as page_id** (codex[bot] P1 + sentry[bot]). Meta's `object_story_spec.page_id` requires a real FB Page ID, not `act_…`. Now requires `META_PAGE_ID` in env or plugin config with a clear error message.
- **`skills/ops-marketing/SKILL.md` — Instagram Story publishing sent duplicate `media_type`** (cursor[bot]). Removed the duplicate form field from the Stories container `curl`.
- **`agents/marketing-optimizer.md` — parser keys mismatched dashboard schema** (codex[bot] P1). Optimizer expected `meta_ads.*` / `google_ads.campaigns[]` / `klaviyo.attributed_revenue` but dashboard emits `meta.*` / raw `google_ads` searchStream array / no `attributed_revenue` field. Rewrote the schema reference to match what `bin/ops-marketing-dash` actually produces, with null-safe jq reductions for the Google Ads path.

## [1.6.1] — 2026-04-16

### Added

- **`ops-package` carrier-agnostic shipping skill** — Unified `/ops:package ship|label|track|list|carriers` entrypoint routing to 7 carrier adapters. Each adapter lives in `skills/ops-package/lib/carriers/<carrier>.sh` and shares common helpers (address parsing, credential resolution, label storage) in `lib/common.sh`.
  - **VERIFIED (live API tested)**: MyParcel.nl (api.myparcel.nl v1.1), Sendcloud (Panel API v3).
  - **UNVERIFIED (modelled from vendor docs, live account pending)**: DHL NL (My DHL Parcel Swagger), PostNL (Send API v2.2), DPD (eSolutions REST), UPS (v2403 Ship/Track REST), FedEx (Ship v1 + Track v1 REST). Adapters tagged `# UNVERIFIED - pending live test with account` in source; payloads may need adjustment against live accounts.

### Fixed

- **MyParcel NL insured shipments force `only_recipient:true` + `signature:true`** — MyParcel's own API contract requires both flags when `insurance > 0` for NL domestic shipments; omitting them returns a 422. Flagged by coderabbitai (Major).
- **`mktemp` temp files leaked on `curl` failure** — Under `set -e`, a failed `curl` short-circuited label flows before `rm -f` ran, leaving stale PDFs in `$TMPDIR`. Fixed in myparcel, dhl, dpd, sendcloud label flows via `trap 'rm -f "$tmp"' RETURN` (scoped to the function, cleared on success path before `save_label_pdf` takes ownership). Flagged by sentry[bot] and chatgpt-codex-connector (P1).
- **OAuth token cache written world-readable in `/tmp`** — `mktemp` inherits the ambient umask; on default systems that's 0644. Added `umask 077` before creating token cache files so only the owner can read them. Flagged by cursor[bot] (Medium).
- **`myparcel_list` recipient concatenation NPE on missing name/city** — `jq` join of `.recipient.name` + `.recipient.city` crashed when either field was absent. Added `// empty` fallbacks. Flagged by cursor[bot] (Low).
- **Dead code: `consume_carrier_flag` and `list_configured_carriers`** — Unused helper functions in `ops-package.sh` removed. Flagged by cursor[bot] (Low).
- **`--carrier` without value crashed under `set -u`** — `CARRIER="$2"` expanded to unbound-variable error when user ran `ops-package.sh --carrier` with nothing after it. Now guards with `"${2:-}"` and exits 64 with a usage message. Flagged by devin-ai-integration[bot].
- **MyParcel `Authorization` header scheme capitalization** — Changed `basic` to `Basic` to match RFC 7235 convention and MyParcel vendor docs (scheme matching is case-insensitive per spec but explicit casing avoids edge-case proxies). Flagged by coderabbitai (Minor).
- **MyParcel list page size** — Bumped default from 10 to 30 to match the API's documented page size and reduce pagination chatter on the typical user's recent-shipment view. Flagged by chatgpt-codex-connector (P2).

## [1.6.0] — 2026-04-16

### Added

- **`bin/ops-discover-external`** — Auto-discovers external (non-git) projects from credentials already configured in the plugin: Shopify stores (via prefs/env), Linear teams (via `LINEAR_API_KEY`), Slack workspaces (via keychain `slack-xoxc`/`slack-xoxd`), and Notion databases (via `NOTION_API_KEY` / keychain `notion-api-key`). Emits a JSON array of ready-to-register candidates with pre-built `config` blocks. Never writes to `registry.json` itself — the setup wizard handles registration after user confirmation. Shopify candidates emit the credential key that actually supplied the token (`SHOPIFY_ADMIN_TOKEN` or `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`) so downstream health checks resolve correctly, and Slack lookups use account=`$USER` (matching `bin/ops-slack-autolink.mjs`) so real installations are discovered.
- **Setup Step 5: "Auto-discover external projects"** — New sub-step in `skills/setup/SKILL.md` that runs `ops-discover-external` after the filesystem git-repo scan, cross-references against the existing registry, and presents only unregistered candidates via batched `AskUserQuestion` calls (≤ 4 options per call, per Rule 1).
- **`ops-projects` external candidate surfacing** — The portfolio dashboard now runs `ops-discover-external` alongside `ops-external` and shows an "UNREGISTERED CANDIDATES" footer listing Shopify/Linear/Slack/Notion projects the user has credentials for but has not yet added to `registry.json`, with a one-line path to `/ops:setup registry`.
- **`ops-projects` external deep-dive** — The `/ops:projects <alias>` jump-to-project view now branches on `type: external` and renders a source-specific deep-dive (Shopify order summary, Linear team issues, Slack workspace health, Notion recent edits) with actions that route to the relevant source-specific skill instead of assuming git/CI/PR context.

### Fixed

- **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`** — Enforcement contact changed from a product support address to the plugin maintainer email (`info@lifecycleinnovations.limited`), matching `SECURITY.md`. Fixes Rule 0 (no personal/product-specific emails in a public repo).

## [1.5.0] — 2026-04-15

### Added

- **`bin/wacli-safe`** — Lock-free one-shot wacli command wrapper. Pauses keepalive sync via pause-signal protocol, runs the command, then resumes automatically.
- **`bin/wacli-health`** — Health check script with `--json` and `--repair` flags for any ops skill to verify wacli + keepalive status.
- **Self-healing service supervisor** — `ensure_all_services()` in ops-daemon enumerates all expected `com.claude-ops.*` launchd agents (macOS) and systemd units (Linux), verifies each is installed with a live PID, and auto-repairs (reinstall, kickstart) unhealthy services. Runs at startup + every 5min.
- **Wacli data cache** — Keepalive writes `wacli_chats.json` and `wacli_urgent.json` to cache every 5min. Daemon intelligence functions read from cache instead of calling wacli directly, eliminating store-lock contention.
- **Periodic backfill** — Keepalive re-checks for chats needing backfill every 30min (configurable via `BACKFILL_INTERVAL`).
- **Missed message detection** — Compares chat metadata timestamps against actual DB content; gaps > 1 hour are auto-queued for backfill.
- **Backfill memory integration** — Writes conversation summaries to `$DATA_DIR/memories/` for the ops memory-extractor to consume.
- **Pause-signal protocol** — `$STORE/.pause_sync` + `$STORE/.batch_wacli` files coordinate exclusive wacli access between keepalive, daemon, and external commands.

### Fixed

- **Keepalive P0 crash** — `detect_missed_messages` was called before its function definition; keepalive exited with status 127 on every machine, never reaching persistent sync.
- **Cache directory never created** — `WACLI_CACHE_DIR` was defined but not included in `mkdir -p`, causing all cache writes to silently fail.
- **Restart delay never applied** — `restart_delay` was logged but no `sleep` happened; services restarted immediately ignoring configured backoff.
- **Launchctl PID parsing** — `awk '/PID/{print $2}'` extracted `=` instead of the PID from `launchctl list` dictionary output; replaced with `launchctl list | awk '$3==lbl'` which parses the tabular format correctly.
- **Plist repair early-return** — `_install_launchd_plist` returned early on live PID even when the destination plist file was missing; service would vanish on reboot. Now requires both file existence AND live PID to skip.
- **Store-lock contention in cache refresh** — `refresh_wacli_cache`, `detect_missed_messages`, and `write_backfill_memory` all called wacli directly during persistent sync. Now use `acquire_wacli_batch` / `release_wacli_batch` to pause sync first.
- **dateutil dependency** — Replaced third-party `dateutil.parser` with stdlib `datetime.fromisoformat` in missed-message detection.
- **Restart counter permanent death** — `max_restarts` counter now resets after 30min of stability instead of staying dead forever.
- **Startup race condition** — 15s delay in keepalive when another `wacli sync` is already running.
- **Daemon version tracking** — Health JSON now includes daemon version from package.json.

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-15

### Added

- **External project support** — Non-repo projects (Shopify stores, Linear teams, Slack/Notion workspaces, custom SaaS endpoints) can now be registered in `registry.json` with `type: "external"` and appear across all dashboards, briefings, fire detection, revenue tracking, and C-suite analysis.
- **`bin/ops-external`** — New data collector that probes external project health (Shopify Admin API, Linear GraphQL, custom health endpoints).
- **`registry.templates/external-project.json`** — Registry template for all supported external project types.
- **`/ops:daemon` skill** — Manage the background daemon (start, stop, restart, health check).
- **gog CLI reference** — Comprehensive command reference added to all agent skills.

### Changed

- **`ops-projects`** — Portfolio dashboard now includes an EXTERNAL PROJECTS table.
- **`ops-go`** — Morning briefing includes external project health status.
- **`ops-fires`** — Classifies external project issues by severity (unreachable=CRITICAL, auth_expired=HIGH).
- **`ops-revenue`** — Pulls Shopify GMV for external stores, adds SOURCE column to revenue pipeline.
- **`ops-yolo`** — Pre-gathers external project data for all 4 C-suite agents.
- **`project-scanner` agent** — Handles external projects in scan output.
- **`infra-monitor` agent** — Probes external projects, fire detection rules for auth_expired/unreachable.
- **`revenue-tracker` agent** — Queries Shopify orders API for GMV on external stores.
- **All C-suite agents** (CEO/CTO/CFO/COO) — Factor external projects into strategic, technical, financial, and operational analysis.

### Fixed

- **`ops-daemon`** — Critical installer, test, and arg-parser fixes.
- **Stale plist and wait bugs** in `ops-daemon.sh`.

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added

- **Notion integration** — Full channel support for Notion workspaces in inbox, comms, and setup flows.

### Fixed

- **Notion search API** — Corrected API usage, added missing tools and API fallback.
- **Setup wizard** — Renumbered sections after Notion insertion, fixed verification command.

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added

- **Agent Teams enforcement** — All agent-spawning skills now support Agent Teams when `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` is set.
- **Discord integration** — `/ops:comms discord` via webhook + bot read.
- **Docker support** — Turnkey container image + compose stack for Linux/CI.
- **Fires-watcher daemon** — Push notification sinks (Telegram/Discord/ntfy/Pushover).
- **`/ops:status` skill** — Lightweight integration health panel.
- **Registry templates** — Starter templates for 4 common stacks (monorepo, Next.js SaaS, Python microservices, React Native).
- **CI release workflow** — Auto-opens PR for version bumps.

### Fixed

- **Daemon** — Services work out of the box on fresh install.

---

## [1.1.1] — 2026-04-14

### Added

- **`docs/os-compatibility.md`** — Authoritative cross-OS reference: support matrix (macOS, Debian/Fedora/Arch/SUSE/Alpine, Windows, WSL2), per-channel install tables, credential cascade explainer, daemon registration mechanisms, browser-profile discovery roots, URL opener resolution, dev/CI guidance, known limitations, contributor testing notes (#100).

### Fixed

- **`bin/ops-setup-preflight`** — Restored `gog calendar calendars --json` (the v1.1.0 release dropped this fix during merge, leaving a probe of the non-existent `gog cal list` that silently wrote `{"error":"failed"}` to the calendar cache) (#101).
- **`bin/ops-unread`** — Error message no longer suggests `npm install -g @example/gog` (a package that doesn't exist on npm); now points to `brew install gogcli` / `winget install -e --id steipete.gogcli` / source build (#101).
- **`skills/ops-inbox/CHANNELS.md`** — Install snippet replaced the private `example/gog` references and invalid `gog auth login` command with an OS-aware `gogcli` install + `gog auth add` flow (#101).
- **`skills/ops-go/SKILL.md`** — Wording fix: "When `gog cal` fails" → "When `gog calendar` fails" (#101).
- **`bin/ops-autofix` + `bin/ops-setup-preflight`** — Back-compat `_cred_*` wrappers now gated by `IS_MACOS` / `[[ "$(uname)" == "Darwin" ]]` so the macOS-only `security` fallback never runs on Linux/Windows (would have crashed under `set -euo pipefail`) (#101).
- **`tests/test-bin-scripts.sh`** — macOS-tool detector now recognizes broader guard patterns (`if [ "$OS" = "macos" ]`, `case "$(uname)" in Darwin)`, the `else` branch of `if declare -F ops_cred_*`), eliminating false-positive failures on `ops-speedup`, `ops-autofix`, and `ops-setup-preflight` that were blocking PR merges (#101).

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added

- **"Configure all" first option in every setup phase** — Enter→Enter→Enter = full optimized install with zero friction. Steps 1 (sections), 2 (CLIs), 3 (channels), and 4 (MCPs) all offer "configure/install everything" as the recommended first option.
- **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** — Contributor Covenant 2.1.
- **Dependabot** — Weekly npm + GitHub Actions version bumps.
- **`.prettierrc.json`** — Explicit formatting config (was implicit defaults).
- **`npm scripts`** — `lint`, `format`, `test`, `type-check` in package.json.
- **Cross-OS foundation** — `lib/os-detect.{sh,mjs}`, `lib/credential-store.{sh,mjs}`, `lib/opener.{sh,mjs}` for macOS/Linux/WSL/Windows portability.
- **Cross-OS CI matrix** — GitHub Actions workflow tests on ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest.
- **Gitleaks coverage** — Custom rules for all 22 integrated services (Shopify, RevenueCat, Sentry, Doppler, Linear, Klaviyo, ElevenLabs, Bland AI, Cloudflare).

### Changed

- **Telegram phone number prompt** — Now a single free-text field starting with `+` instead of country-specific presets.
- **Setup wizard gog install** — Points to `steipete/gogcli` (public) with cross-OS install table instead of private repo.
- **All `gog` commands updated** — `gog auth login` → `gog auth add`, `gog cal` → `gog calendar events`.

### Fixed

- **Gitleaks false positives** — `curl-auth-user` in SKILL.md docs, example phone numbers, `$STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` env var references.
- **Prettier formatting** — All `.mjs`/`.js`/`.json` files formatted with explicit config.

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added

- **`/ops:monitor`** — Unified APM surface for Datadog, New Relic, and OpenTelemetry. Active alerts, error traces, entity health. `--watch` for live polling.
- **`/ops:settings`** — Post-setup credential manager. Shows integration status, allows selective updates with smoke tests.
- **`/ops:integrate`** — Onboard any SaaS API into the partner registry (WebSearch discovery → confirm → credential → health check).
- **`monitor-agent`** — Lightweight haiku-4-5 agent for APM polling.
- **`templates/nestjs-api/`** — Full NestJS API template with JWT auth, BullMQ queues, Prisma, Fastify, health endpoint, multi-stage Dockerfile.
- **`templates/nextjs-saas/`** — Full Next.js SaaS App Router template with Auth.js v5, Stripe billing, Prisma, Tailwind, shadcn/ui.
- **`@claude-ops/sdk`** — npm package with TypeScript types (SkillManifest, AgentManifest, PluginManifest, HooksConfig) and `create-ops-skill` CLI scaffolder for third-party skill authors.
- **Automated release pipeline** — GitHub Actions workflow triggered on v\* tag push, parses CHANGELOG, creates GitHub Release.
- **Ubuntu 24.04 CI** — Full test suite runs on both ubuntu-latest and ubuntu-24.04.
- **Merge conflict resolution** — `/ops:merge` now auto-rebases on `origin/main`; on failure offers accept-theirs / accept-ours / manual / skip.
- **CLAUDE.md plugin rules** — Plugin-root `CLAUDE.md` with two hard rules enforced across all skills: (1) max 4 options per `AskUserQuestion` call (schema limit), (2) never delegate CLI commands to the user — run via Bash tool instead (exception: `wacli auth` QR code).
- **Shopify admin app template** — `templates/shopify-admin-app/` — full Shopify Admin Remix template with all admin scopes, forked from Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix.
- **`bin/ops-shopify-create`** — Non-interactive Shopify app scaffolding script. Automates device-code OAuth (auto-opens browser via `expect`), fetches org ID from Shopify Partners API cache, runs `shopify app init` with all flags, and injects client ID into `shopify.app.toml`.
- **`expect` as required CLI** — Added to `bin/ops-setup-preflight` detection and `bin/ops-setup-install` for browser-automation flows.
- **Test suite** — New `tests/` directory with bash-based validation covering skills, bin scripts, hooks, templates, and secrets.
- **`briefing-pre-warm` daemon service** — Runs `bin/ops-gather` every 2 minutes and caches dashboards so `/ops:go` loads in <3s instead of <10s. Registered under `ops-daemon` alongside wacli-keepalive and memory-extractor.
- **Early daemon install (Step 2c of setup wizard)** — Setup wizard now installs `ops-daemon` immediately after CLI tooling so the `briefing-pre-warm` service can start caching `/ops:go` data while the remaining setup steps run. Step 5b became "daemon service reconciliation" (verify + restart) instead of fresh install.
- **`/ops:revenue` actual revenue tracking** — `revenue-tracker` agent now queries Stripe (charges, subscriptions → MRR, balance, disputes, open invoices, churn) and RevenueCat (mobile subscription MRR, active subs, churn). AWS cost data still included alongside revenue. `/ops:setup` Step 3k prompts for Stripe + RevenueCat credentials.
- **New `userConfig` keys** — `stripe_secret_key`, `revenuecat_api_key`, `revenuecat_project_id` added to `plugin.json`.
- **`infra-monitor` full-AWS coverage** — Service discovery probes IAM access per service, then reports on ECS, EC2, RDS, Lambda, S3 (flags public buckets), CloudFront, ALB/NLB, API Gateway, SQS (backlogs + DLQ), SNS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache, Route 53, ACM (cert expiry), CloudWatch alarms, Budgets, and IAM (stale access keys).
- **Wiki revamp** — 10 wiki pages rewritten with 2026 GitHub formatting (badges, mermaid diagrams, alert callouts). New pages: `Daemon-Guide`, `Memories-System`, `Plugin-Rules`, `Changelog`, `Privacy-and-Security`.
- **Privacy & Security transparency** — new `Privacy-and-Security.md` wiki page and README section explicitly document every credential scan source, what the daemon does on disk, and the plugin's no-telemetry / no-phone-home stance.

### Changed

- **AskUserQuestion <=4 enforcement** — All 15 skills audited and fixed. setup section picker (11→batched 4+4+3), setup channel picker (7→4+3), ops-comms / deploy / fires / go / inbox / linear / projects / revenue / speedup / triage / yolo all batch >4 menus with `[More options...]` bridges. ops-dash hotkey menu refactored.
- **Subagent models bumped Sonnet 4.5 → Sonnet 4.6** — `comms-scanner`, `infra-monitor`, `project-scanner`, `revenue-tracker`, and `triage-agent` now run on `claude-sonnet-4-6`. `yolo-*` agents stayed on `claude-opus-4-6`; `memory-extractor` stayed on `claude-haiku-4-5`.
- **Agent Teams adoption** — `/ops:fires`, `/ops:inbox`, `/ops:merge`, `/ops:orchestrate`, `/ops:triage`, and `/ops:yolo` now use the `TeamCreate` + `SendMessage` primitives for parallel agent coordination instead of sequential `Task`-based dispatch.
- **`/ops:speedup` is now OS- and hardware-agnostic** — auto-detects macOS / Linux / WSL / Windows, selects the right sub-script per platform, and degrades gracefully when tools are missing instead of erroring out.

### Fixed

- **`gog` install fallback chain** — Setup wizard now tries `npm install -g @example/gog` → `bun install -g @example/gog` → `git clone https://github.com/example/gog ~/.gog && ./install.sh` → clear manual instructions. Removed the previous incorrect pointer to `Lifecycle-Innovations-Limited/tap/gog` (Homebrew) — `gog` is a private `@example` CLI and is not distributed via Homebrew.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-13

- **`/ops:voice`** — Voice channel management
- **Daemon cron jobs** — Competitor intel, inbox digest, store health monitoring scripts
- **Message listener** — Real-time message event processing via wacli

- **Dynamic partner discovery** — Ecom/marketing setup detects installed platforms automatically
- **docs/** — Full reference documentation (skills, agents, daemon, memories)

### Fixed

- MCP namespace corrections across 8 skills and 3 agents (Linear, Gmail, Sentry)
- Broken YAML frontmatter in ops-comms, ops-triage, ops-yolo
- All 19 audit gaps resolved (100/100 score)

### Changed

- README updated with v0.6.0 features, architecture diagram, new skills table
- Plugin userConfig expanded: Klaviyo, Meta Ads, GA4, Search Console, Shopify, ShipBob keys

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-13

### Added

- **ops-daemon** — Unified background process manager (launchd). Manages wacli sync, memory extraction, and future services with auto-heal, bootstrap sync, and auto-backfill for @lid chats.
- **ops-memories** — Daemon-spawned haiku agent extracts contact profiles, user preferences, communication patterns, and conversation context from chat history every 30 min. Writes structured markdown to `memories/`.
- **wacli-keepalive** — Persistent WhatsApp connection with bootstrap sync, auto-detection of empty @lid chats, health file contract (`~/.wacli/.health`), and launchd integration.
- **Doppler integration** — Setup wizard detects and configures Doppler CLI for secrets management. All skills can query secrets via `doppler secrets get`.
- **Password manager integration** — Setup wizard detects 1Password (`op`), Dashlane (`dcli`), Bitwarden (`bw`), and macOS Keychain. Configures query commands for agent use.
- **CLI/API reference tables** — All 14 operational skills now include complete command reference tables with exact syntax, flags, and output formats for wacli, gog, gh, aws, sentry-cli, and Linear GraphQL.
- **Deep context inbox** — ops-inbox and ops-comms now read full conversation threads (20+ messages), build contact profiles across channels, search for topic context, and draft replies matching user's language and style. Safety rail: NEVER send without full thread understanding.
- **PreToolUse hooks** — Automatic wacli health check before any WhatsApp command. Daemon health surfaced to user when action needed.
- **Stop hooks** — Session cleanup removes stale worktrees and temp files.
- **Runtime Context** — Every skill loads preferences, daemon health, ops-memories, and secrets at execution time.

### Changed

- **Plugin feature adoption ~35% → ~85%** — All 19 skills annotated with `effort`, `maxTurns`, and `disallowedTools`. 3 heavy skills use `claude-opus-4-6`. 4 read-only skills block Edit/Write. All 10 spawnable agents have `memory` (project/user scope). 4 scanner agents have `initialPrompt` for auto-start. Triage agent has `isolation: worktree`.
- **Setup wizard** — New steps for Doppler (3f), password manager (3g), and background daemon (5b). Daemon replaces standalone wacli launchd agent.
- **ops-inbox** — Full thread reads (20 msgs not 5), contact profile cards, topic search, cross-channel history, language/style matching in drafts.
- **ops-comms** — Full conversation context required before any send. Health pre-flight for WhatsApp.

## [0.4.2] — 2026-04-13

### Added

- **`bin/ops-autofix`** — Silent auto-repair script for common ops issues. Fixes wacli FTS5 (rebuilds with `sqlite_fts5` Go build tag), registers Slack MCP (from keychain tokens), and registers Vercel MCP. Runs non-interactively with `--json` output. Supports `--fix=all|wacli-fts|slack-mcp|vercel-mcp` targeting.

### Changed

- **`bin/ops-doctor`** — Now runs `ops-autofix` after diagnostics and reports any auto-applied fixes.
- **`bin/ops-setup-preflight`** — Now runs `ops-autofix` as a background job during preflight, so `/ops:setup` auto-repairs issues before the wizard even starts.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-13

### Added

- **`/ops:dash`** — Interactive pixel-art command center dashboard. Visual HQ with instant hotkey navigation (1-9, 0, a-h), live status indicators (fires, unread, PRs, GSD phases), C-suite report viewer, interactive settings editor, share-your-setup social flow, and FAQ/wiki section with links. `/ops` with no args now launches the dashboard instead of a text menu.
- **`/ops:speedup`** — Cross-platform system optimizer. Auto-detects macOS/Linux/WSL, scans for reclaimable disk space (brew, npm, Xcode, Docker, trash, logs, tmp, app caches), reports memory pressure, runaway processes, startup bloat, network latency. Health score (0-100). Tiered cleanup options: quick/full/deep/custom/memory/startup/network. On macOS, leverages the existing comprehensive `speedup.sh` for deep optimization.
- **`bin/ops-dash`** — Shell script that renders the pixel-art dashboard with parallel background data probes (projects, PRs, CI, unread, GSD, YOLO reports).
- **`bin/ops-speedup`** — Shell script for cross-platform system diagnostics (OS detection, hardware fingerprint, disk/memory/process/network metrics). Supports `--json` flag for machine-readable output.

### Changed

- **`/ops` router** — Empty args now launch `/ops:dash` instead of showing a static text menu. Added routing for `speedup`, `clean`, `optimize`, `cleanup` to `/ops:speedup`.
- **Telegram setup** — After authenticating via `ops-telegram-autolink.mjs`, credentials are now auto-written to the MCP config. No more manual paste into `/plugin settings`.
- **GSD companion install** — Now installs automatically with a single "Yes" instead of telling users to run slash commands manually.

## [Unreleased — legacy drafts]

### Added — autolink wizards for Telegram and Slack

- **`bin/ops-telegram-autolink.mjs`** — zero-browser Telegram user-auth wizard. Takes a phone number, uses plain HTTP against `my.telegram.org` (pattern borrowed from [esfelurm/Apis-Telegram](https://github.com/esfelurm/Apis-Telegram) — `my.telegram.org` is fully server-rendered so no Playwright/Selenium is needed for api_id extraction). Scouts existing credentials in macOS keychain and `~/.claude.json` first. If none found, posts phone to `/auth/send_password`, waits for the user's code via `/tmp/telegram-code.txt` bridge file, POSTs `/auth/login`, GETs `/apps`, regex-extracts `api_id` + `api_hash`, creates an app if none exists, then runs gram.js `client.start()` to generate a session string (handling a second code via the same bridge). Final result: JSON line to stdout with `{api_id, api_hash, phone, session}`.
- **`bin/ops-slack-autolink.mjs`** — Slack token wizard with scout-first, Playwright fallback. Scouts `~/.claude.json mcpServers.slack`, process env, macOS keychain (`slack-xoxc`/`slack-xoxd`), shell profile files, and Doppler. If nothing is found, launches Playwright with a persistent Chromium profile dir at `~/.claude-ops/slack-profile`, navigates to `app.slack.com/client/`, waits for the user to log in via a bridge file (`/tmp/slack-login-done`), then extracts the `xoxc-...` token from `localStorage.localConfig_v2.teams[teamId].token` and the `d` cookie (`xoxd-...`) from the cookie jar. Ported from [maorfr/slack-token-extractor](https://github.com/maorfr/slack-token-extractor) (Python → Node).
- **`skills/setup/SKILL.md` Step 3a + 3d rewritten** to invoke these binaries as background processes via the file-bridge pattern, and to display instructions for wiring extracted values into `/plugin settings` (we do not auto-write to `~/.claude.json` — that's Claude Code's internal file and the plugin must not touch it).
- **New deps**: `playwright` (~200MB Chromium browser on first install) added to `telegram-server/package.json`. Only required if the user chooses to run the Playwright fallback path for Slack — scout-only mode has no dependency on Playwright.
- **Bumped to v0.2.2** — `plugin.json` + `marketplace.json`. Earlier user-auth-only fixes were v0.2.1.

### Fixed — public-repo hygiene pass

- **Scrubbed `scripts/registry.json` from all git history** via `git filter-repo` + force-push. The file contained real project data (paths, repo slugs, revenue stages, infra topology) and was tracked in the repo since day one. Now gitignored, with `scripts/registry.example.json` as a starter template.
- **Removed `.planning/` from tracked files** (`git rm -r --cached`). Previously leaked internal phase docs, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, PROJECT.md. Gitignored going forward.
- **Refactored hardcoded project references to registry-driven iteration** in 7 files: `agents/yolo-cto.md`, `agents/yolo-coo.md`, `agents/infra-monitor.md`, `agents/triage-agent.md`, `agents/comms-scanner.md`, `skills/ops-deploy/SKILL.md`, `skills/ops-triage/SKILL.md`, `skills/ops-next/SKILL.md`, `skills/ops-projects/SKILL.md`. All loops now read `.projects[].repos[]` / `.paths[]` / `.infra.ecs_clusters[]` / `.infra.health_endpoints[]` from `scripts/registry.json` (with `registry.example.json` fallback). Sensible defaults shown in example tables use `example-app` / `example-api` instead of real project names.
- **Removed hardcoded personal data**: hardcoded email in `agents/comms-scanner.md` replaced with preferences-driven `channels.email.account`. Hardcoded home-dir fallback removed from `skills/setup/SKILL.md` detector invocation.
- **Rewrote README installation section** to reflect marketplace-plugin install flow (`/plugin marketplace add` + `/plugin`), not manual `git clone` + `settings.json` editing.
- **Rewrote README Telegram section** to match the v0.2.0 user-auth rewrite (gram.js MTProto) with API ID / API hash / phone / session flow instead of obsolete Bot API token flow.
- **Bumped `marketplace.json` to 0.2.1** to match `plugin.json`.
- Registered `.gitignore` superset: `node_modules/`, `.env*`, editor swap files, `.planning/`, `.claude/worktrees/`, `.DS_Store`, `*.log`, `scripts/preferences.json`, `scripts/registry.json`.

### Added

#### Interactive setup wizard (`/ops:setup`)

- `skills/setup/SKILL.md` — end-to-end config wizard with `AskUserQuestion` selectors
- `bin/ops-setup-detect` — JSON state probe (tools, env vars, MCPs, registry, prefs)
- `bin/ops-setup-install` — idempotent Homebrew/apt installer for CLI dependencies
- `~/.claude/plugins/data/ops-ops-marketplace/preferences.json` — owner, timezone, verbosity, default channels, channel secrets. Lives in Claude Code's per-plugin data dir so it survives reinstalls and version bumps; never stored in the plugin source tree.
- Routes `setup|configure|init|install` in the `/ops` command router

#### WhatsApp auto-heal (Step 3b of wizard)

- Detects stuck `wacli sync` processes via stale store lock + age check
- Detects app-state key desync via `wacli sync` stderr probe (the `didn't find app state key` error class)
- Offers to kill stale sync / logout + re-pair interactively
- Automatic historical backfill via `wacli history backfill` on top 10 most-recent chats after a successful heal

#### Email + Calendar with MCP fallback

- **Email**: primary `gog` CLI (full read + send); fallback Claude Gmail MCP connector (read-only until user grants send perms in Claude Desktop → Connectors)
- **Calendar**: primary `gog cal` (shared gog OAuth token); fallback Google Calendar MCP connector (read-only until user grants write perms in Claude Desktop)
- Both record the chosen backend in the plugin-data `preferences.json` (`channels.email`, `channels.calendar`) so downstream skills (`/ops-go`, `/ops-next`, `/ops-fires`) can cross-correlate with today's schedule
